prices have now officially hit \"bear\" territory, having slid more than 30 per cent since their February peak and pushing down to 5-month lows.\n\nKey points: Iron ore supply ramps up while Chinese steel mills seasonal restocking ends Market is now in \"bear territory\" as prices slump 30pc in past two months Every $US10 a tonne fall in iron ore price cuts government revenue by $4 billion a year\n\nThe acceleration in the price slump is being driven by both sides of the market equation with a surge of supply hitting at the same time demand is throttling back and massive stockpiles of iron ore are building up at Chinese ports.\n\nWith seasonal restocking of steel mills winding up, analysts see the price only going down from here.\n\nSpot prices have been volatile, although the overall trend is precipitously down.\n\nA 2.2 per cent rebound on Wednesday to $US64.20 a tonne only clawed back a bit of the 8 per cent slide of the previous two days trade.\n\n\"We've seen prices now off 30 per cent in a very short period of time and we believe there's probably a little bit more to go on the downside unfortunately,\" Bell Potter dealer Giuliano Sala Tenna told The Business\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if we saw iron ore dip below 40 dollars a tonne in the very short period of time and then normalise back to 55 dollars a tonne.\"\n\nMr Sala Tenna said much of the rally up to $US94 a tonne was not built on very solid foundations and in large part driven by speculators.\n\nIron ore stockpiles at Chinese ports are reaching mountainous proportions, at last count a record 130 million tonnes, or enough to build around 13,000 Eiffel Towers.\n\n\"We've seen the steel sector, particularly in China, come under pressure,\" Mr Sala Tenna said.\n\n\"We've seen some price discount in there in product, we've seen stockpiles at the ports increase quite significantly and that's now translated via some real pressure in the iron ore industry.\"\n\nVolume increases putting small miners under pressure\n\nAll the while, the huge investments the big miners — BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue and Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill — have made in their operations have led to ever-increasing volumes of iron ore being shipped out.\n\nBut Fortescue's Nev Power isn't worried and told The Business last week he expects the price to settle at around $US60-to-65 a tonne.\n\n\"We've seen it overshoot well and truly and now we're seeing it returned to more historical levels,\" Mr Power said.\n\n\"We expect there could be some volatility in the short term but longer term it will come back to where you would expect it to be off the supply curve.\"\n\nBut it is unlikely BHP, Rio and Fortescue will be able to replicate substantial profits they reported in February.\n\nFor the junior miners, the picture is far grimmer and any sort of profit would be welcome after years of massive losses.\n\nAt best their half-year profits were marginal and many were still hadn't made it back to the black.\n\nSala Tenna said there has already been some rationalisation in the industry and more may be in the pipeline.\n\n\"If the iron ore price was to come back at $55 a tonne the benchmark level, then we'd expect a number of the second tier miners such as your Atlases of the world would be under pressure again where there operations may be loss making,\" he said.\n\nBudget repair could be delayed by falling prices\n\nBut it is not just the miners who are feeling the pinch.\n\nTreasurer Scott Morrison will be scanning the daily downward shift in prices with some concern as he frames the Federal budget which will be brought down in May.\n\nWestpac's chief economist Bill Evans warned if prices drop to the mid $US50 range, it will put pressure on May's Federal budget — and plans to repair the looming budget deficit.\n\n\"If it is, say, $10 lower over the course of the whole year, then that's worth about $4 billion to the budget,\" Mr Evans told The Business on ABC TV.\n\n\"But for now, it won't leave a big budget black hole, as government forecasters were cautious and correctly predicted the current price drop.\n\n\"I believe they've been quite expert in predicting the fall from the 80 down to the 60 that's occurred since MYEFO [Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook],\" Mr Evans said.\n\nA prolonged slump will be a different matter.\n\nFor investors there's plenty to fret about as well.\n\nThe big miners have shed around 15 per cent since their February peak, Fortsecue is down more than 20 per cent and some of the smaller miners have seen their share prices halved or worse.\n\nAnd like the iron ore price, share valuations may still have a way to go before bottoming out.\n\nTopics: iron-ore, mining-industry, steel, markets,

He'd taken prescription drugs off script and he'd been drinking.\n\nWhen they tried to wake him in the morning, they found him cold.\n\n\"He had a fly on his lip. Once they touched him he was cold and they tried to resuscitate him and called the ambulance but he was already dead,\" he told Hack.\n\nThe toxicology report found the cause of death to be drug toxicity. He had oxycontin and antidepressants in his system. Alcohol intoxication was also found to be a significant factor.\n\nMarco was 25 years old.\n\nThe danger of prescription drugs\n\nChristo remembers Marco as the strong, outgoing and sporty friend who came to his school in year six.\n\n\"We spent a lot of time together. We'd surf together and play soccer and I'd try to stop him annoying everyone.\"\n\nMarco left school after year 10 and started a trade. In his twenties, he developed anxiety and depression and was prescribed Lexapro and Valium. Christo says he would also keep the benzodiazepine Xanax, which he wasn't prescribed, on hand to deal with his panic attacks.\n\nMarco had a heart condition and was wary of recreational drugs like ecstasy and cocaine. Christo worries that his use of prescription drugs to deal with his mental health may have given him a false sense of security.\n\n\"He was savvy to the risks that those drugs posed considering his condition but probably not in terms of prescription drugs.\n\nPeter Wearne, from the Youth Support and Advocacy Service, says prescription drugs can be incredibly dangerous, when taken off script or when more than one substance is mixed.\n\n\"The potentiation effect is one plus one equals five, not two.\"\n\nHe says we need to address the far too high incidence of people abusing prescription drugs.\n\n\"They can be very useful in numbing the distress that you feel. The problem is the numbing is only temporary.\n\n\"The issue that we're not tackling is what is the driver for people using this medication in an off script or dangerous way?\"\n\nA recent report from the Victorian Coroners Court found that when people die from drugs, they've usually taken more than one type.\n\nThe most common pharmaceuticals to play a role are benzodiazepines, followed by opioids and antidepressants. In around a quarter of deaths, alcohol also plays a part.\n\nChristo believes it is important to share Marco's story to warn other people about the danger of prescription drugs.\n\n\"I don't think people are aware,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone is well aware of the dangers of recreational drugs but not so much prescriptions ... and that's what killed our friend, the abuse of something that's given to us to help us supposedly.\"\n\nIf you are struggling with drug use you can find help at http://yourroom.com.au/", "title": "'I don't think people are aware': The heartbreaking toll of prescription drugs", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/the-heartbreaking-toll-of-prescription-drugs/8443926", "main": "http://www.abc.net.au", "fact": "HIGH"}

Any chance I could ask you a couple of quick questions on camera?\"\n\nI point up the concrete stairs, at the top of which ABC cameraman Greg Hatch is waiting, alongside him a highly visible camera and tripod.\n\nGlancing quickly at the gear, Kalac turns back and smiles wryly. \"Nah, sorry mate. I've got to get going soon.\"\n\nThat's code for no. I nod understandingly, then as I start to move away Kalac goes out of his way to make a point about his goalkeeping protege.\n\n\"Look Vedgy is going well. Really well. He's ready.\"\n\nSport's cutthroat nature caught out Janjetovic in a big way this season.\n\nThe 29-year-old rose to become the go-to between the sticks at cross-town rival Sydney FC, but when the club recruited Vukovic last year, their loyalty shifted.\n\n\"It was really tough. It was the first time in my career where I had to deal with something like that, I reached out to a few people for guidance on how to get by,\" says Janjetovic, who almost walked away from the sport.\n\nHe took personal leave from Sydney and sought the counsel of those who he could trust.\n\n\"Popa [Wanderers coach Tony Popovic] and Zeljko were some of the people that I looked to during that period. They told me to relax and just be myself and try not to worry about everything on the outside.\"\n\nDealing with the anxiety and stress of the situation wasn't easy for Janjetovic, especially with news of his displeasure at Sydney circling.\n\n\"Everyone I did reach out to, helped me,\" he says.\n\nKalac coached Janjetovic at the Sky Blues before he himself moved to the Wanderers in 2015 to join his good friend and trusted former national team-mate Popovic at the club.\n\nNot surprisingly it's been Kalac, a former Socceroo goalkeeper who had reached acclaimed success across Europe, who's been one of the key figures in Janjetovic's resurgence.\n\n\"I have to thank Zeljko for just believing in me. There are times when I don't believe in myself and he is always there to give me a kick up the backside and say 'you can do it, we want you here'.\"\n\nIronically, Janjetovic's performance against his old club in February stamped his arrival at the Wanderers. It was a triumph of character that wasn't lost on his team-mates.\n\n\"He's a real leader from the back there. He has a lot of experience and a calm head. He has played with many great players at Sydney FC and that shows,\" says 20-year-old defender Jonathan Aspropotamitis.\n\nThe Wanderers training grounds in Blacktown are sparse.\n\nSitting in the grandstand, talking to Janjetovic about his future and his fight, the keeper's gaze often drifts out over the sunburnt grass of the training field below, circled by an ageing burgundy athletics track.\n\nBut when I ask him about the prospect of a grand final qualifier against his old club, his focus sharpens.\n\n\"To be honest, I really don't know how I will feel about that. I don't want to go there yet,\" he says.\n\nIf Western Sydney beats Brisbane, the Wanderers will take on premiers Sydney FC in what stands to be a mouth-watering Sydney derby.\n\nTopics: a-league, soccer, sport, parramatta-2150, sydney-2000, nsw, australia", "title": "Vedran Janjetovic keeping well for Western Sydney Wanderers ahead of A-League finals", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-20/vedran-janjetovic-keeping-well-for-western-sydney-wanderers/8456948", "main": "http://www.abc.net.au", "fact": "HIGH"}

In that medium, which is just a liquid, we have components that will support their metabolism.\n\n\"While they're actively metabolising, they're going to be producing a lot of reactive oxygen species and waste products, so there are other components in that media that will help to clean them up.\"\n\nCryopreservation technology, where sperm is frozen, has been used for years, but the scientists said it increased the risk of damage to the sample.\n\nStoring the sperm at ambient temperature, with appropriate nutrients to support their survival, negated that risk.\n\n\"The ability to transport sperm around the world has been around for the last 50 years, but it does require cryopreservation,\" Dr Gibb said.\n\n\"The process of cryopreservation can be very damaging to the cells, and it can cause them to have an extremely reduced lifespan once you thaw them out, so the fertility is generally quite markedly reduced.\"\n\nNew technique could break down international boundaries\n\nJen Clulow, a veterinarian involved in the project, said the ability to transport sperm at ambient temperatures would help studs wanting to breed their horses with animals overseas.\n\n\"If we were able to use our ambient temperature media to transport [sperm] from America to Australia to breed mares, then we would be able to potentially harness the genetic potential from that stallion and put it into an Australian horse population,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers are trying to minimise potential biohazards and eliminate any bacterial contamination by investigating the best device to transport the sperm.\n\nDr Swegen said it was an exciting development for the Hunter's breeding industry.\n\n\"It is a wonderful advantage for the breeders in the area, and I think it's great they'll be able to get their hands on something that's a world-first,\" she said.\n\n\"It's also great for the equine breeding industries around the world.\"\n\nTopics: animal-science, science-and-technology, newcastle-2300, university-of-newcastle-2308, scone-2337", "title": "Scientists develop new method for keeping horse sperm alive for longer at ambient temperatures", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-19/scientists-develop-new-method-for-keeping-horse-sperm-alive/8450364", "main": "http://www.abc.net.au", "fact": "HIGH"}

The humour relies on many rerefences to pop culture, wordplay, as well as an element of physical comedy or clowning.\n\nThe comic sketches unfold like stories within a story, at the center of which are a young girl and her new friend, a book that comes to life.\n\nIn a sense the young girl’s journey embodies the audience's experience, as she opens her eyes to social issues that the book reveals story by story.\n\nSome of the issues presented include a woman facing the stigma that surrounds infertility, another being forced to drop her ambition to become a professional athlete under pressure from her family to get married and the frustrations of another woman under the authoritarian guardianship of her brothers.\n\nOther stories reflect on the death of romancing by Kasr El-Nil bridge, once the go-to spot for Cairene lovers, and the deterioration of street and social ethics.\n\nGender-focused\n\nThe audience at Hosapeer was composed mostly of youth, in the age range that would relate to the issues on stage.\n\nZohney and the play’s producer Karim El-Shenawy began the project by looking at other similar plays, finding elements they liked and others they wanted to see more of, and elaborate upon.\n\n“We wanted to see a play [on these issues] that was a comedy, not too direct, and also [targetted towards a] very young audience, and with a strong gender focus. It was also very important for us to steer away from the circle of audience we know that are already aware and familiar with all these subjects,” Zohney told Ahram Online.\n\nZohney’s professional background is in gender based violence, as she worked with UN Women for six years, and is currently working at the German development agency GIZ.\n\nHer introduction to theatre and storytelling came through her participation in Tahrir Monologues and Bussy Project.\n\n“Through my work in development I also worked on projects that used theatre as a social tool. One project was in El-Minya using theatre to talk about domestic violence. So I learned more about how theatre can be used not only as entertainment, but for [spreading] awareness,” she says.\n\nAs such, one of the elements they wanted to see more of on stage was women's issues, which they felt were marginalised.\n\nWhile most of the subjects in Untangled involve women, there is also one that centres on men, reflecting on modern gym culture, peer pressure, different masculine motives for working out and thoughts on how to attract women.\n\n“The play is gender sensitive, not women-oriented or feminist. So it’s about masculinity as well, and the mainstream and social pressures,” Zohney says, adding that they plan to add more sketches that are male-centred.\n\nAn evolving script\n\nIn fact, the play is in constant development and the script freshly updated for last week's performances, which was obvious in references to some very recent popular events.\n\n“For the latest staging we had changed some parts of the script and changed the ending from how it was in November. Every time we adapt, even if the sketch is the same. It doesn’t make sense that things happen around us and we don’t include them, so we’re not isolated,” she says.\n\nSome of the segments were previously longer, including one that centred on arranged marriages, and another on a young woman who wanted to become the leader of a mostly-male acting troupe in her university. One of the newly added segments focused on the life of a divorced woman.\n\nThe initial scriptwriting was an equally dynamic process.\n\n“Mohamed Fouad, the director, formulated the script to stage. I would suggest a subject, then we'd start researching and gathering facts. The characters were not written, we gave the actors the framework and allowed them to add from their own experiences,” Zohney says.\n\nThe quick dialogue is complemented by the actors’ presence on stage, each presenting a distinct character with their own peculiarities.\n\nThe actors’ skills were shadowed at times, however, by top-of-the-lung speech that was common with too many characters, and for too long.\n\nThough the high energy was often for comic effect, it was as if the actors were all trying too hard to be seen and heard, where a variation in the tones of delivery would have made the characters even more compelling and enjoyable and given the script more space to hold its own.\n\nHeavy made humorous\n\nThe script, in colloquial Arabic, is one of the aspects that carries the play and makes it engaging as well as more accessible to the audience. Another is the creative angle with which the stories are presented: not a one like the other.\n\nOne of the skits is a television show analysing a video of a woman being physically harassed or raped - this is left for the viewers to decide - while bystanders fail to help her in any way.\n\nZohney explains that because of the heavy subject this was a very difficult scene that took a lot of work and consideration over how to present it.\n\n“We’re not spotlighting the rape itself; rather, we wanted to focus on the fact that people are judging it from the comfort of their homes. We tried to shift the attention to looking at how we as a people react. We also didn’t want to make it too morbid,” she says.\n\nThe scene was still made humorous, leaving one feeling uncomfortable about laughing given the tense subject matter.\n\n“I noticed this reaction comes mostly from women, being hesitant and almost ashamed to laugh about it. But I think to men it becomes a soft introduction to the topic from another angle,” Zohney adds.\n\nOn the play’s future, Zohney says this year they are working to have it staged for a duration of two weeks or a month.\n\n“As much as we liked Hosapeer Theatre, it needed a big production budget to make it as good as we wanted it. Last year, we had funding from UNDP, which helped us financially, so this year we are on our own. We want to have the play be very flexible, so we can stage longer or shorter versions of it depending on the possibilities we have,” Zohney says.\n\nIn terms of marketing and outreach, up to this point the team have been dependent on social media.\n\n“Now we are trying to expand the network of people who hear about it. Then maybe afterwards we can tour the cities, and integrate issues specific to other places in Egypt outside Cairo,” Zohney concludes.\n\nFor more arts and culture news and updates, follow Ahram Online Arts and Culture on Twitter at @AhramOnlineArts and on Facebook at Ahram Online: Arts & Culture\n\nShort link:\n\n", "title": "Untangled: Gender-focused comedy brings realities of Egyptian youth to stage", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/35/263080/Arts--Culture/Stage--Street/Untangled-Genderfocused-comedy-brings-realities-of.aspx", "main": "http://english.ahram.org.eg", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "Egypt's cabinet approved on Monday a nationwide three-month state of emergency, which President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi declared hours after two deadly suicide bombings hit St. George Cathedral in Tanta and St. Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria, killing 45 and injuring dozens more in the deadliest attack against civilians in Egypt's recent memory.\n\nAccording to the Egyptian constitution, any state of emergency must be upheld by parliament by majority vote within seven days of its declaration by the president. The Egyptian House of Representatives is set to vote on the state of emergency on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the second state of emergency imposed nationwide in Egypt in the last four years.\n\nIn 2013, Egypt's interim president Adly Mansour declared a one-month state of emergency following a wave of violence in the wake of the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.\n\nThe state of emergency grants authorities expanded powers including trying civilians in special courts, restricting or regulating movement in public places, and more authority to regulate media outlets.\n\nSpecial trials\n\nLaw 162, which regulates the powers of the state under emergency, allows for the trial of civilians before “special” courts, including the “Emergency High State Security Court,” upon orders by the president, who has the right to appoint army officers in the judicial panel of these courts.\n\nAccording to Article 9 of the law, the president has the right to refer defendants in criminal cases to these special courts for any crime.\n\nAccording to Article 12 of the law, the verdicts of these courts are not subject to appeal as they are in regular courts, with only the president maintaining the right to overturn verdicts, order a retrial or reduce sentences.\n\nThe sentences of these courts are put into effect after approval by the president.\n\nFreedoms\n\nThe state of emergency law gives authorities the right to shut down or set operating hours for commercial shops.\n\nAuthorities are also granted the right to evacuate or cordon certain areas, as well as specify or restrict means of transportation.\n\nAuthorities are also empowered to withdraw licences for weapons, ammunition, flammable material and fireworks.\n\nThe law grants the state the right to assume guardianship of private companies and properties per an order by the president.\n\nArticle 4 of the law grants broader authority to the country’s Armed Forces, including jurisdictional authorities usually reserved for law enforcement bodies.\n\nThe law also gives the state the right to impose curfews, though no such plan has been announced by authorities for this most recent state of emergency.\n\nMedia\n\nThe state of emergency grants the president the right to oversee all means of communication, expression, and advertising prior to publication, as well as the power to confiscate and shut down print houses.\n\nDuring a late night address to the nation on Sunday, El-Sisi urged all media outlets to be \"credible, responsible and aware\" when covering news and images related to terrorist incidents, and not to “hurt the feelings” of the victims by broadcasting images of their deceased relatives “all day long.”\n\nThe state of emergency in Egypt\n\nStates of emergency have historically been implemented in countries around the world to preserve the security and stability of nations during times of danger, such as during wars, natural disasters or other unusual circumstances.\n\nAn ongoing state of emergency has been in effect in designated areas in North Sinai since 2013, as the army battles a militant insurgency in the area. The state of emergency has been continually renewed at three-month intervals since 2013.\n\nThe state of emergency announced on Sunday will be implemented nationwide in accordance with Law No. 162 of 1958.\n\nThe 2014 constitution says that a state of emergency is to be imposed under the following conditions:\n\n- The President must consult with the cabinet before imposing the state of emergency.\n\n- Parliament must approve the state of emergency by majority vote.\n\n- The state of emergency shall be declared for a specified period not exceeding three months.\n\n- Parliament must approve by majority vote the renewal of the state of the emergency.\n\nThe country’s first state of emergency was implemented in 1914 by a British mandate in all territories of the Egyptian sultanate during the World War I.\n\nAfter the 1952 revolution and the establishing of the republic in 1953, the state of emergency was imposed in1956 during the tripartite aggression against Egypt, and was lifted in 1964.\n\nA state of emergency was again declared in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war, and continued until 1980.\n\nFollowing the assassination of president Anwar Sadat in 1981, the state of emergency was imposed again and extended every three years during the entire 30-year rule of his successor Hosni Mubarak.\n\nFollowing the uprising that toppled Mubarak in February 2011 – with the continued state of emergency being one of the protestors’ grievances – the state of emergency was lifted by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) in May 2012, ending the longest state of emergency in the country's history.\n\nShort link:\n\n", "title": "What does Egypt's state of emergency involve?", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/262685/Egypt/Politics-/What-does-Egypts-state-of-emergency-involve.aspx", "main": "http://english.ahram.org.eg", "fact": "HIGH"}

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "In 2014, Alexandra-born architect Dalia Sadany made headlines when she became the president of the International Association of Designers (IAD) after ranking 12th at the World Designer competition the same year.\n\nSadany sat down with Ahram Online to discuss a passion for architecture that paved the way to award-winning projects, her hands-on design philosophy and her intention to shed light on Egypt's talents in the field.\n\nAhram Online: How do you describe the onset of your passion for this career?\n\nIt was extremely circumstantial, not intended or planned. I just fell in love with it as I was studying it.\n\nAO: Tell us about the balance between visual appeal and practicality?\n\nIt is actually the job of the architect, to be able to do that equation. The whole point of being successful in design and architecture is that you can balance the need to have a successfully functional space with something that appeals visually. First comes functionality and then my designs work to mirror it.\n\nIf the work is residential, we are talking about mirroring human beings. If it is corporate, we mirror the occupation of that space. If it has to do with retail, we mirror a certain product. In regard to the visual aspect that makes the work appealing, it has to do with taste.\n\nAO: Do you try to maintain an Egyptian cultural element in your creations?\n\nYou cannot actually define an Egyptian cultural element because Egypt has so many styles combined. So if we are talking about an Egyptian Identity, then I would say it is my lifetime goal.\n\nI definitely try to maintain that [identity] but with a certain twist; I don’t imitate in regard to anything that we call \"Egyptian\" or ethnic, but rather give that Egyptian feature a sort of a futuristic aspect.\n\nWe do have history that we must be proud of but we cannot keep copying what we have historically; we have to add to it. Abroad they don’t have as much history as we do, so they will always be hungry for designs that have a story, and we have lots of stories to tell.\n\nAO: You are an advocate of the \"The master builder\" approach; could you explain that?\n\n\"The master builder\" is responsible for all phases from concept design to handover, like back in the pharaonic age; there was the architect who would design and construct, and he was also a craftsman.\n\nI am not belittling designers who don't do that; it's just a different approach. I'm a hands-on person, and I like to work on site, and this approach had been gaining traction worldwide.\n\nBack in the 1800s there came a sort of revolutionary idea to segregate designers from contractors, and since then, people started to look down on contractors. But, all of a sudden the mischief of that approach surfaced, and we saw mega products having problems that went back to the missing link between these two entities. That’s why there was a third entity created to solve these problems: the project manager.\n\nAO: As a multi-award winning designer, which projects from your portfolio are the closest to your heart?\n\nThe ones that were done in Egypt, like renovating Tahrir Square, the new educational hub that I did, even El-Hegaz Square, because they come from an emotional experience and are related to certain problems that I see around me.\n\nAO: Tell us more about your ground-breaking recent project on the American University in Cairo Greek campus?\n\nI was somebody who didn’t believe in corporate design. I didn’t think that companies were interested in investing in design, especially in Egypt.\n\nThis was proven wrong. I met with the CEO of the company in charge of [building] the intended training facility, and I was taken with the interest in design that was expressed. They told me to design what I feel, and this was music to my ears.\n\nWe talked about the idea of creating this educational hub, and investing for IT students, especially for public university graduates, which really touched me.\n\nThis hub was like an incubator; through it the graduates and I saw how their lives changed and how they found better opportunities, so I took that project deeply to heart.\n\nWhen people from abroad complimented the work saying that they couldn’t believe it was made by an Egyptian designer, it made me happy and it made me sad. It saddens me that there is not enough focus on the calibre of designs and creative minds in Egypt.\n\nAO: As president of IAD, you pioneered an initiative to honour and encourage Egyptian designers. Tell us more about that.\n\nAs soon as I became president, I wanted to begin drawing international attention to pioneers and landmarks in the field of design. We discussed candidates from 12 fields of design.\n\nI wanted to give back to these names in their country, so we talked the board of IAD into flying down from Milan to honour theses names. We honoured two companies in Egypt.\n\nEveryone really appreciated that they were honoured in their own country. I have won awards all over the world, but it makes all the difference when it is done in ones' own country.\n\nAO: You have written educational articles about architecture and spoken about inspiring homeowners to build their own houses. Are you still passionate about writing in that regard?\n\nI am still very passionate, but I wish I had more time. Juggling so much becomes tedious and you have to focus, but I will return soon to writing about the field to teach people how to design and build in simple ways.\n\nAO: What are you looking forward to contributing to the society?\n\nA lot. Sometimes when we try to help we get setbacks, but you stand back again and you try. I want to make this country worth its reputation and history. It is a beautiful country and although I studied, lived and worked abroad, something irreplaceable makes me very attached to my homeland.\n\nAO: Amid the economic crisis prevailing now, how is an interior designer affected?\n\nDifficulty purchasing anything! We cannot provide bills of quantity, as prices fluctuate crazily, especially lacking an entity that would filter prices or help maintain a ceiling. This has done huge damage to designers and architects; many have stopped working.\n\nAO: What obstacles must be removed to pave the road for more creation and art in that regard?\n\nThe main obstacle would be removed if the [project creators] in this country really believed in the minds of [Egyptian] designers. It saddens me that whenever there is a mega project, they would prefer to get a foreign designer.\n\nAlso we have to expand horizontally: no point in getting more designers to work if we don’t have land and projects for them.\n\nShort link:\n\n", "title": "INTERVIEW: Dalia Sadany sheds light on hidden talent of Egyptian designers", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/7/47/262659/Life--Style/Style/INTERVIEW-Dalia-Sadany-sheds-light-on-hidden-talen.aspx", "main": "http://english.ahram.org.eg", "fact": "HIGH"}

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2016-11-15 21:22:13+01:00", "authors": ["Joseph Braude", "Joseph Braude Is An"], "content": "By Joseph Braude\n\nThe public discussion over JASTA has evolved — at that, rapidly — in recent weeks, as the hypothetical “veto override” became a reality. In venerated opinion pages such as that of the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, three substantial arguments against the bill emerged:\n\nFirst, concerns were raised that the bill, in green lighting American courts to prosecute any foreign government — including even American allies — would create a dangerous precedent. It would invite, for example, the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings in Japan to sue the United States for the killing of hundreds of thousands. Or perhaps, for example, the victims of the Mai Lai massacre in Vietnam would sue the U.S. in a Vietnamese court. American assets, spread as they are in banks and businesses throughout the world, would be vulnerable — as would American soldiers and diplomats — to confiscation or even arrest. A Wall Street Journal editorial added, moreover, that “Given AMerica’s role in international banking, for instance, or its support of Syrian groups whose actions have sometimes varied from what was initially intended, could Washington be held responsible for much of the world’s terrorist financing, if only by oversight?”\n\nThe second argument, to the surprise of many, was acknowledgment that the Saudi government, as an institution, has truly been cleared of responsibility for the September 11 tragedy. In other words, whereas US Government culpability in the mass killing of innocents in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, North Vietnam, and elsewhere is not disputed — and to the contrary, has been widely acknowledged in the United States itself — the Saudi government as an institution has been cleared of any direct involvement in the 9-11 killings. For that matter, Saudi Arabia has been a primary target of Al-Qaeda — and in fact, fell prey to Al-Qaeda terrorism years before the phenomenon reached America’s shores.\n\nThe third argument is that the political fallout of prosecuting the kingdom would be disastrous for the United States and the Middle East as a whole. At the present time, American officials and elites, after visiting the kingdom and learning about “Vision 2030,” are praising the direction in which the kingdom is going.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “The Anti-Saudi posturing is building at the moment the Saudis are showing a greater commitment to domestic reform and the antiterror effort.” and calling for increased cooperation. a prosecution of the Saudi government would, to the contrary, alienate the kingdom and its population from the United States. It would push it into the arms of America’s rivals, whether Russia or China or other countries, with which the kingdom is cultivating ties anyway. In doing so, it would also discourage Saudis from considering methodologies of socioeconomic reform which the United States has pioneered, as a potential model for their own structural reforms. Thus JASTA would have a devastating effect on the Saudi-American relationship, for a generation if not more. A New York Times report from Riyadh observed in substance that this trend has already begun: The JASTA legislation, it noted, “was all the proof many Saudis needed that the alliance that has underpinned the regional order for decades was fraying — perhaps irreparably. … Saudis responded to the passage of the bill, after both houses of Congress voted on Wednesday to override Mr. Obama’s veto, with a mix of anger and disappointment, while many have already begun thinking about how their country will need to adjust.", "title": "The Aftermath of the JASTA Veto Override", "url": "http://eng.majalla.com/2016/11/article55252481/aftermath-jasta-veto-override", "main": "http://eng.majalla.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Culturally, artist Dor Guez—who was born in Jerusalem to Palestinian Christian and Tunisian Jewish parents—is a strange mix, although it is easy to forget that he also embodies the various human migrations that led to the creation of the state of Israel as it is today.\n\nGuez’s Palestinian Christian grandmother and her family were forced out of their hometown of Jaffa during the 1948 war. They relocated to Al-Lydd, which was renamed Lod by Israeli conquerors, where Guez’s mother was born and where they lived as one of the few remaining Palestinian families. Guez’s father’s Tunisian Jewish family moved to Lod in the 1950s, one of many Jewish immigrant families to settle in the newly formed Israel.\n\nChristian Palestinians constitute 2.3% of the Israeli population; most Palestinian Christians today live abroad, and perceive themselves culturally and linguistically as Arab Christian. Discussing his unusual heritage with The Majalla and his own sense of identity—whether he identifies himself more with Christianity or Judaism, and as an Arab, a Palestinian, a Tunisian or an Israeli—Guez emphatically states that he is “one hundred percent of all of these labels.”\n\nGuez’s latest exhibition, 40 DAYS, is currently showing at the Mosaic Rooms in London. It focuses on the Christian Palestinian and minority experience, offering a nuanced understanding of Palestinian and Israeli society. Through a mix of photography, documents and video installations—some of which depict the artist’s maternal relatives, who speak Hebrew—40 DAYS helps to dispel generalizations by inviting the viewer to question their ideas of ethnicity and nationalism. The exhibition also challenges assumptions about the state of Israel, and about Palestinian ethnicity being equated only with the Muslim faith. However, Guez edges away from the exclusively religious aspect of the Christian Palestinian identity; as he says, “It’s a culture, not just a faith.” Instead, the exhibition presents a picture of a very humble existence through scenes of familiar and mundane activities.\n\nMinorities are often hit the hardest in times of unrest, and these communities in the Middle East have suffered under the effects of globalization, nationalism and cultural changes. While this suffering has been due mostly to the erosion of their cultural groups, it also arises from insufficient awareness of their situation. “Generally, the position of a minority—everywhere in the world—is not only a question of been outnumbered, it also relates to media coverage, history and writing,” Guez says, although he does point out that “the topic of minorities in the Middle East, like the Christian Palestinians, is actually been heard more and more in the last few years, especially after the Arab Spring.”\n\nMemory, Guez says, is what motivates him artistically. Perhaps preserving their memories is one way as an artist to preserve the existence of these communities.\n\nMemory, Guez says, is what motivates him artistically. Perhaps preserving their memories is one way as an artist to preserve the existence of these communities. Photographs of desecrated grave sites bearing the sign of the cross in Lod cemetery form a main component of 40 DAYS. The force that was used to carry out the vandalism is evident by the fact that the sturdy stone grave coverings have been broken into pieces, revealing the bones of the deceased. Guez’s late grandfather, Yaqoub Monayer, captured the images to take to the police as evidence. When they failed to find the perpetrators, the photos were returned to him and were subsequently put away in a kitchen drawer. There, they were left for years to deteriorate, and became stuck together in the humidity. The photos of the grave sites have been scanned and enlarged and show the tearing around the edges, which presents them as objects with their own story, their own memory.\n\n40 DAYS is a means of preserving the intricacies of the everyday condition of a minority community; it also serves to resurrect buried and suppressed individual memories. In one of the scenes in the video installations, we see a close-up of Guez’s grandmother’s hands as she thumbs through the images, pulling the stuck ones apart, causing the tearing. In discussing the event, she recalls that one of the graves belongs to her mother. Guez has said that the photos “tell the story of what they refuse to talk about directly.” A second photo in the exhibition, of the wedding of his grandparents, was discovered by the artist in a plastic bag under the bed. The wedding took place in Al-Lydd just one year after the 1948 war.\n\nDor’s use of his family in this exhibition presents a highly intimate portrait of the community, which is humbling as well as touching and deeply personal. But the character who we become most intimate with is the main subject, Guez’s grandfather, whose final moments and burial site feature in the exhibition in a video also called 40 Days, the name given to ceremony held in the Orthodox church after this period of mourning.\n\nGuez says of his grandfather, “He had an enormous influence on my education, and on the way I relate to my cultural and political environment—he had a strong influence on my visual expression.” In the film, Watermelons under the Bed, we see Guez’s grandfather, lying in his bed with his back to camera, discussing the changing times. Every now and then, he turns around eagerly, to test the quality of watermelons that are handed to him. In another shot, he is seen peeling prickly pears in the kitchen. Both fruits have symbolic meaning for Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nIn the same video, an adult subject who is being interviewed is discouraged from talking about politics by his mother, who is off camera. As a member of a small community, she is clearly cautious about discussing such matters. “What am I, a child?” he asks.\n\nPerhaps this is the generational gap that Guez mentions. “A lot of political Palestinian movements across the Middle East were actually founded by Christians. Personally, I think that the first and maybe the second generation after 1948 are more cautious [about discussing politics]—definitely not the third.”\n\nAs a member of this more outspoken third generation, Guez’s desire to record and preserve the history of his family and his people is admirable, and extends beyond this exhibition. He is currently assembling an online database that includes thousands of images from the Christian Palestinian diaspora. It is, as Guez states, a community project, as individuals contribute their own family photos to the archive. “In my eyes, the subject matter is not a story of one community, but the story of us all as individuals facing cultural changes. It is a personal reflection about questions of identity, culture and memory.”\n\n*Amy Assad is London-based writer who specializes in the arts and culture of the Middle East.

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-15 12:33:22+01:00", "authors": [], "content": "HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — The last time that a state put more than one inmate to death on the same day was more than 16 years ago when Texas executed two condemned killers in back-to-back lethal injections — they were declared dead 33 minutes apart.\n\nOther than the moment when one of the men lashed out at family members and police officers who testified against him at trial, the executions went quietly and without any difficulties.\n\n“I don’t remember any problems,” said Jim Willett, the warden in the death chamber the evening of Aug. 9, 2000, when the double execution happened. “I’m not trying to make light of it, but if you can do it right once, why can’t you do it twice the same day?”\n\nNot even Texas, the nation’s most active death penalty state, has scheduled multiple executions in a single day in recent years. In today’s capital punishment landscape, death penalty opponents are as vocal as ever and some states have struggled with drug shortages, legal challenges and flawed executions.\n\nAmid all this, Arkansas had scheduled a series of executions starting Monday that would include the first double executions since the one in Texas in 2000. The state initially planned to execute eight inmates in all, starting Monday, with four nights of double executions through the end of the month, as the state rushes to beat an expiration deadline for one of the three drugs it uses to carry out an execution. But after judges halted two of the executions, Arkansas’ plan was in limbo Friday after a state judge blocked the use of one of its lethal injection drugs — a decision that could effectively halt the executions altogether.\n\nSome attorneys and anti-death penalty groups question whether the quick turnarounds will stress out the prison staff and cause mistakes. Three years ago in Oklahoma, an attempt to execute two inmates on the same April day was thwarted after the first prisoner writhed and moaned on the gurney in a lethal injection the corrections chief tried to halt before the inmate’s death 43 minutes later. An investigation found intravenous lines had been connected improperly, in part because of the “extra stress” from the scheduling of two executions the same day.\n\nThat execution led the Supreme Court to review and ultimately uphold Oklahoma’s use of midazolam, the same sedative that Arkansas plans to use next week as part of a three-drug protocol. Texas uses a single drug, pentobarbital, in its lethal injections.\n\nExecutions of multiple inmates are not new to Arkansas. It has twice executed three inmates on the same day — in August 1994 and January 1997. And it put two inmates to death the same day both in May 1994 and September 1999. Arkansas officials in the past defended the multiple executions as reducing stress and saving overtime costs for corrections personnel.\n\nBut more recently, capital punishment has been stalled in Arkansas because of drug shortages and legal challenges. The last execution in the state was in 2005.\n\nAsked about the potential for difficulties if Arkansas were to carry out back-to-back executions, criminal justice professor Robert Lytle said, “If I’m being perfectly honest, I don’t know.”\n\nLytle, who teaches at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said so much attention has been given to the unprecedented timetable.\n\n“I’ve got to think everybody is dotting their i’s and crossing their t’s,” he said. “I can see some logistical issues creating some difficulties but I’m sure if that’s all it is, I can see the Department of Correction will adapt however they need to.”\n\nThere was a time when executing more than one prisoner on a single day was common — records show at least seven states carried out multiple single-day executions in 1951.\n\nVirginia electrocuted four inmates Feb. 2, 1951, and three more three days later. The men — all black and known historically as the Martinsville Seven — were all convicted of raping a white woman at a time when rape was a capital offence.\n\nThat same year in New York, a couple known as the Lonely Hearts Killers were electrocuted back to back March 7, 1951. Two more prisoners were put to death the next day in the same electric chair.\n\nIn Texas, records show multiple executions 28 times starting in 1924 when the state took over execution duties from counties and electrocution became the capital punishment method. For its inauguration on Feb. 8, 1924, the new electric chair was used five times.\n\nBut since the 1976 Supreme Court decision allowing the death penalty to resume, multiple executions have been rare. The pair of lethal injections that Willett, the former Texas warden, presided over in 2000 was the last of 10 such executions over six years involving only four states: Texas, Arkansas, Illinois and South Carolina.\n\nWillett, who oversaw 89 executions before he retired in 2001 after 30 years with the prison system, said his tenure also included a series of seven lethal injections over 15 days in January 2000, a run similar to Arkansas’ planned executions.\n\n“I do remember it seemed to kind of drain me near the end of that January bunch,” he said. “I just seemed to be emotionally drained.”", "title": "Executing Multiple Inmates the Same Day Was Common, Now Rare", "url": "http://eng.majalla.com/2017/04/article55253397/executing-multiple-inmates-day-common-now-rare", "main": "http://eng.majalla.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2016-08-09 21:26:06+01:00", "authors": ["Joseph Braude", "Joseph Braude Is An"], "content": "by Joseph Braude\n\nAs a child I used to listen to broadcasts from faraway places via short wave radio, the transmission typically uneven and full of static. Today those distant voices come in clear as a bell, via streaming audio on any smartphone. Late the other night I was surfing Arabic radio stations, from Baghdad to Algiers, and by chance heard two women speaking the language impeccably — but with a peculiar accent.\n\n“Dear listeners,” one of them said, “how did you spend your day?”\n\n“Every new day gives us new hopes and aspirations,” said the other.\n\nWhere were these women from? I wondered. I listened awhile, and eventually a haunting oriental melody and a man’s voice say, “From the Korean capital Seoul, we meet again over the airwaves — coming together in love, in goodness, and in hope.”\n\nIt turned out to be the Arabic service of the South Korean government’s “Korean Broadcasting System.” Top-of-the-hour news detailed the country’s military preparations to face its saber-rattling neighbor to the north, and a visit to Europe by the Korean president. It was read by an Egyptian man, but followed by a business report from another man, again with a Korean accent. “Korean exports exceeded $50 billion for the month of October,” he said — “a new record for a country that exported only $19 million a year following its independence from Japan.” Following station identification, the Korean ladies returned and recounted the growing number of Emaratis and Egyptians who had taken proficiency exams in the Korean language. “Ma sha allah,” one said. “And so continues the advance toward the furthering of relations and friendship between Koreans and Arabs, which will increase our mutual cooperation and understanding of one another, God willing.” The show goes on to cover the latest in Korean cinema and music and teach you how to say things like, “Hey, how’s it going” and “What’s your name” in Korean. As the clock strikes the hour, the show loops back to the beginning and repeats — just one hour of new content per day.\n\nI grew curious: What are Koreans hoping to accomplish exactly by broadcasting to the Arab world?\n\nThe following morning, I visited Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has studied the expanding Asian footprint in North Africa and the Middle East. “South Korea sees the Arab world as an important market — for manufactured goods, for construction — and they get virtually all their oil from the Middle East.\n\nKoreans have a contract to build nuclear reactors in Abu Dhabi, he went on, and a detachment of military personnel are helping train the Emirati special forces. “I think South Korea sees itself coming into the commercial role that the US has traditionally occupied, and creating some reciprocity between the South Korea thirst for oil and the South Korean ability to manufacture. But one of their challenges is that nobody has heard of Korea. I mean, people have heard of China; it has ancient relations with the Middle East. People have heard of Japan, which has very longstanding relations with a lot of countries. No word comes to mind when people think about Korea, and they’re trying to invest that idea with something.\n\nApparently, this would be where the Korean Broadcasting Service in Arabic comes in. It is a tool for what Americans call public diplomacy — that is, a proactive effort to influence foreign publics in support of a country’s foreign policies. The United States invests hundreds of millions annually in its own public diplomacy outreach to the Arab world, including the nonstop broadcast Radio Sawa, airing on local FM radio across North Africa and the Middle East. Sawa competes for Arab attention with rival broadcasts from China, Russia, Iran, and every country in Western Europe, as well as transnational movements ranging from the Muslim Brotherhood to the Vatican. Viewed together, such efforts amount to a multibillion-dollar industry — but whether the broadcasters are achieving their political objectives is unclear.\n\nPhilip Seib, a professor of Journalism, Public Communications, and International Relations at the University of Southern California, has his doubts. “Everybody in the world, just about now, is broadcasting in Arabic,” he told me, “but not every Arab is listening to them. Even the BBC these days is having trouble getting an audience in the Arab world, and they’ve got an established reputation. What I know from spending time in the Arab world is that a lot of these foreign broadcasters have spent a lot of money to reach just a handful of people.”\n\nIt is difficult to gauge how much money foreign powers are spending or determine their ratings in the region. Audience research in the Arab world is still at a junior stage, uneven in coverage and sometimes unreliable. But one useful indicator, at least as far as younger listeners is concerned, is the number of Twitter followers a given radio network has. Out of curiosity, I checked KBS Arabic’s Twitter account and compared it with that of America’s Radio Sawa — and discovered that the little network is punching high above its weight: Whereas 24-hour-a-day Sawa, with an annual budget in excess of $22 million, has won 60,000 Twitter followers, Korea’s Arabic service, with only three full-time employees and one hour of programming daily, has managed to exceed 10,000.\n\nSo what is the secret of Korea’s success?\n\nTo learn more, I called KBS headquarters in the Korean capital Seoul and spoke with Bae Jung-Ok, director of the Arabic section, who goes by the name Lu’Lu’a when on the air. She greeted me warmly. “Whenever I host a program or an interview, I always wonder whether anybody out there hears the reflections of my heart,” she said. And ma sha Allah, you are in Washington and you heard me. Wow. It’s a dream come true.”\n\nI asked her how she views the nature of her work.\n\n“They call us civil ambassadors,” she explained. “We try as much as we can to be bridges between the two cultures. That’s how we feel about what we do, and our Arab guests see us that way too. There’s a lot in common between Arab and Korean cultures. For example, young people respect the elderly. Many of the same oriental values are present in both cultures. I think this makes it a lot easier to narrow the distance between us. “\n\nKBS Arabic is no spring chicken, Bae Jung-Ok explained. It has been on the air since September 1975, not long after the October 1973 Arab oil embargo which was launched in response to American support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war. The embargo caused a spike in oil prices and a global recession — and drove home the message that foreign powers ignore Arab feelings at their peril.\n\n“In the early ‘70s,” she said, “there was the energy crisis, and there were no Arab affairs specialists in Korea. So the government focused on developing Arabic language expertise. Over time we realized that we needed as well to foster cultural, academic, and social cooperation — and one can’t get close to other countries for economic motivations alone.”\n\nThirty-eight years later, the network still operates on a shoestring budget, with 20 part-time freelancers helping out the full-time staff of three — but finds that its audience is vastly larger. Having barely any bureaucracy to navigate appears to be a sort of a blessing for KBS Arabic, in that the staff keeps nimble and directly engaged with listeners, and enjoys the freedom to tweak the programming based on what works. Bae Jung-Ok feels that her success in growing the audience has been due largely to the intensely personal relationship she fosters with listeners.\n\n“Ordinary listeners from, say, Algeria, would send us a ‘listeners’ report,’” she explained. “That is, they would tell us how they came to hear us, and give feedback positive and negative. Eventually in time, they also started talking about personal matters. For example, ‘Today’s my birthday,’ or, ‘My daughter got married,’ or, ‘My wife had a baby” — and we would begin to respond to them on the show. One day a listener let us know in advance that on such-and-such day he was going to get married. At that time I was hosting a music segment. And so of course I congratulated him during the show and dedicated a song to the happy couple. He was very happy, and he recorded it and played it at the wedding. Such exchanges of emotions can be very powerful.”\n\nThe KBS approach may work out fine for a relatively small country, new to North Africa and the Middle East, which is trying to make a good first impression on Arabs. But its recipe for success may be barely relevant to a superpower like the United States which is well known, ubiquitous, not entirely well liked, and struggling to defend sweeping policies and vast interests. Nor for that matter is KBS Arabic even trying to become a source of news and information about the world beyond the Korean peninsula. Nonetheless, there is at least one glaring lesson which the great powers can draw from KBS — and that is the benefits of having Arabs share the microphone with those native citizens of the country whose impeccable Arabic speaks to their devotion to understanding and relating to Arab societies. At this time are no American-born broadcasters on the US-backed Radio Sawa or, for that matter, Britons on the BBC Arabic or Chinese nationals on Beijing’s CRI.\n\n“When the Arabic section of KBS got started,” Bae Jung-Ok recalled, “we had only Korean graduates in Arabic studies from the university to use as broadcasters. Over time their Arabic got better and better. But in the 21st century, Arabs have started gushing into Korea. Many of them live here now, and we have begun to mix the two voices on our programming — Arabs and Koreans together. And I think the audience response has been better as a result. They always tell us, ‘You’re different than the other foreign networks. Usually they just use Arab broadcasters, whereas you have your own citizens working side by side with Arabs.’ Maybe this is our advantage.\n\nSouth Korea — unlike China, Russia, or Iran — is an ally of the United States. But, does it follow that the growing relationship between Korea and the Arab world is an asset to the United States? And are the implications of Korean-Arab ties for American policy — whether toward the Middle East or with respect to the widely touted “pivot to Asia”?\n\nJon Alterman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies views the relationship as a mixed bag. “On the one hand, strategically we do see eye to eye with South Korea,” he said. “But commercially they’re competing against American companies in many cases. I would expect that this is going to be a relationship which is partly satisfactory and partly unsatisfactory. I don’t think they want to replace the United States, but they certainly want to supplement the United States.” Looking ahead, he added, “It may be that we don’t important Middle Eastern oil directly in the coming years, but we important MIddle Eastern oil indirectly, when we buy products that are manufactured in Asia and then sent to the United States. Since those products are manufactured on Middle Eastern energy, we become tied to the whole development of Asian-Middle Eastern relations. And our economy becomes tied — no longer mediated through the sort of Levant-centered, legalistically centered, traditional Middle East policy, but through a more mercantile, free-flow-of-trade, protecting-the-sea-lanes orientation. What that means I think is that we have to think more about who’s paying to protect the sea lanes. And does it make sense for the United States to provide all this security for free when other consumers — huge consumers — of energy are freeloading on American efforts?”\n\nIt is clear in any case that under the shade of America’s security umbrella in the Middle East, Koreans have been making strong inroads. Are there ways in which the United States could benefit from those inroads, whether on the ground or over the airwaves? Sometimes even a superpower can use some help — and to quote an old Korean proverb I just learned in Arabic translation, a great river does not refuse small streams.", "title": "Korean Voices Make Waves on Arabic Radio", "url": "http://eng.majalla.com/2016/08/article55250758/korean-voices-make-waves-arabic-radio", "main": "http://eng.majalla.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

It can be classed neither as a revolutionary organization—it is no Palestine Liberation Organization or African National Congress—nor as a true opposition umbrella group, like the Alliance for Change that toppled Milošević. Its purpose is similarly perplexing. It claims to represent the aims and aspirations of the Syrian people, yet it has no presence on the ground and little say over what people do there. It promises international intervention—or at the very least the arming of the Free Syrian Army—yet NATO has explicitly ruled out becoming involved. And while the SNC makes a big fuss about its humanitarian work, what little money that reaches the deserving is often marked by corruption. If the SNC is not an effective leadership body, a relief organization, or a particularly good lobby group, what exactly is it?\n\nThis question did not seem to have perturbed the minds of the hundred or so oppositionists who gathered in Istanbul last month to debate widening the group’s membership. At the end of nine tortuous days of horse-trading punctuated by haranguing from foreign ambassadors, they eventually settled on a list of 114 members, up from a mere sixty. There are now more liberals, FSA officers and representatives of local councils in the internationally recognized and supported body. “The coalition has succeeded in undergoing the expansion,” declared acting president George Sabra. He is right. The coalition did succeed in Istanbul, but only in the same way as Hezbollah triumphed in Qusayr: at great cost.\n\nBut unlike Hezbollah, Syria’s oppositionists are not new to loss of prestige. They have been the butt of newsroom jokes for years, well before the popular uprising exposed their incompetence to all and sundry. The problem is that this time, their squabbling risks disturbing that last fig leaf of credibility: that they, despite their obvious faults, represent an alternative vision of politics to that of the Assad regime.\n\nThat claim is becoming increasingly harder to sustain. Take, for instance, the way that SNC members are chosen. Elections are out; in are the much-favored muhasasa (share-allocation) and tawafuk (consensus) methods, in which seats are dispensed by a committee of apparatchiks in a manner that aims to keep rival factions of (mostly exiled) oppositionists happy. When faced with criticisms over the ineffectiveness of the body, the usual answer is to expand membership to co-opt those complaining from the sidelines. The exact criteria for membership is kept conveniently elastic; that is how Ghassan Hitto, an unknown businessman who was an expatriate in Texas for thirty years and who has no experience of opposition politics, can end up as interim prime minister. Indeed, that is how Sabra himself—having failed to win a minimum number of votes in the Syrian National Council election last November—was handpicked by a shadowy inner circle to become first the head of the council (the largest bloc within the coalition), and then the coalition’s acting president.\n\nTake also the delicate matter of “foreign interference.” Days into the Istanbul meeting, SNC figures began talking of “external pressures” being applied to accept resolutions that have been cooked up by Russia and the West. “A strong media campaign is underway against the SNC because it refused to submit to pressures,” tweeted Abdulkarim Bakkar, an SNC member. “The coalition fought for independent national decision-making and got most of what it wanted,” he added.\n\nWhile all this sounds terribly heroic, the reality is that the SNC is heavily mortgaged to the Qatar–Turkey axis and is as much “independent” of the two as Assad is of the Iranians. Now, internal disputes within the SNC have to be settled by the group’s regional backers and the resolution of the conflict rests in the hands of US secretary of state John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. The fact is that the SNC owes its legitimacy not to the backing of ordinary Syrians, but to the willingness of the West and Arab states to do business with it. This is precisely the sort of legitimacy that Assad enjoyed before the uprising, and which the SNC oppositionists hope will propel them to power.\n\nThe SNC also suffers from a lack of achievement, a corporatist mindset, disdain for the ordinary man, aversion to institutional transparency and accountability, and a disinclination to anything resembling intellectual honesty. What is the SNC? Well, it is a collection of self-interested individuals who see themselves as intermediaries between foreign powers and local communities in a strategically important part of the Middle East. They are essentially glorified middlemen who, quite naturally, spend most of their time in luxury hotels conceiving plots, striking deals, arranging payments, and every so often appearing on TV to condemn whatever crime Assad is committing.\n\nThis “go-betweener” role, which involves a great deal of clientelism and conspiracy, has been a constant function of the Syrian political elite. In the 1950s, it was split along pro-Hashemite and pro-Saudi/Egyptian lines until Hafez Al-Assad eliminated elite infighting by imposing himself as supreme middleman.

Conservative forces are attempting to stay in control of the country’s educational system, while the moderates are hoping to increase the autonomy of Iran’s universities. The outcome of this conflict will be a litmus test for the level of academic freedom permitted under the current administration.\n\nThe regime’s struggle to control academia is not new. Even before the contested 2009 Presidential Election, Iran’s universities were a hotbed of political activity. A series of student protests of July 1999 that began as a peaceful demonstration in Tehran were violently suppressed after six days of demonstrations and riots across the country. The desire to closely monitor and regulate student and faculty activities is therefore logical from the perspective of the country’s political elite, if they want to eliminate the chance of a spark that could result in mass public dissent.\n\nBearing this in mind, it was inevitable that the latest showdown between Rouhani’s administration and hardline conservatives would take place. It arose from the decision of Rouhani’s Minister of Science, Research and Technology, Reza Faraji-Dana, to alter the selection process of university presidents—an act that was met with swift opposition from those promoting more strict controls over the academic community.\n\nIn the new process, a university’s faculty can nominate a qualified individual from among themselves to the Science Ministry. The minister then submits the nomination to the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCRC) in order to get the official stamp of approval. Among many other responsibilities, this conservative-dominated council is in charge of ensuring that the educational and cultural institutions of Iran remain “Islamic,” as the council understands it.\n\nUntil now, university faculty members were not consulted in the process, and the minister has also named a candidate of his own choosing to the SCRC. The previous system paved the way for the nomination of under-qualified candidates who, based on nepotism or political loyalty, were given leadership roles at Iranian universities.\n\nConservative elements within the regime have objected to the new selection process, wary of granting more autonomy to higher education institutions. In this regard, Mansour Kabganian, a member of SCRC, stated: “The Council believes that nomination and selection of candidates is the Health Minister’s and Science Minister’s right. The minister can ask for the advice of anyone during the process, but on the other hand, the approval or rejection of the candidate is the right of the Council.” Hardline website Rajanews published an article criticizing the administration by asking the rhetorical question, “what is the administration dreaming up? The independence of universities or disturbing the educational peace by so-called democratic gestures?”\n\nThe battle reached its climax in late June, when fifty lawmakers attempted to impeach Faraji-Dana. Among their reasons they listed the readmission of students who had previously been expelled, and the new university president selection process. After a parliamentary hearing, the impeachment process was postponed for a month on the condition that the minister would take the next thirty days to “investigate and resolve the impeachment items.”\n\nFaraji-Dana further elaborated on his mission and the opposition of conservative figures during the inauguration ceremony of Mahmoud Nili Ahmad Abadi, the new Dean of Tehran University. “Universities are responsible to society,” he said. “Therefore, they should have sufficient authority to conduct their own affairs . . . [Conservatives believe] if the university faculty advises the Science Minister regarding the selection of the dean, the authority of higher-ups will be violated,” Faraji-Dana stated.\n\nSome attempts at reform have also been made to reverse other ill-conceived policies from hardline former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. During his time in office, a number of laws and operational rules were altered in favor of the conservatives. As a result, the level of political interference in the country’s academic environment increased, which also resulted in the hiring of faculty members who were aligned with the administration’s ideology. Faraji-Dana is currently investigating 3,000 fellowships granted under Ahmadinejad, and says he will cancel those that were awarded illegitimately.\n\nFearing an unnecessary escalation of the conflict between political factions, the county’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, chimed in during a meeting with a group of university professors. “Officials and the heads of universities must make serious efforts to prevent scientific hubs from turning into places for the activities of political groups,” Khamenei stated on July 2.\n\nRouhani continues to promise more academic freedom in Iran, but the opposition to his plans has been strong. The ultimate acceptance or rejection of the Science Minister’s proposed changes by the SCRC will certainly be an indicator of the fate of attempts to grant more independence to the country’s universities in the future.\n\nThus far, the administration’s opponents are doing what they can to hinder the reform process by delaying the nomination of candidates, threatening to impeach the Science Minister, and accusing the administration of breaking laws. The outcome of the conflict is not certain, but a rejection of the Science Minister’s proposed changes would decrease any hope for short-term improvements in academic freedom in Iran.\n\nAll views expressed in this blog post are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, The Majalla magazine.", "title": "Rouhani Goes to College", "url": "http://eng.majalla.com/2014/07/article55250614/rouhani-goes-to-college", "main": "http://eng.majalla.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels ruled that Iran and Hezbollah materially and directly supported al Qaeda in the September 11, 2001 attacks and are legally responsible for damages to hundreds of family members of 9/11 victims who are plaintiffs in the case. Al-Sharq al-Awasat pan-Arab daily, which published the US court documents, revealed that a New York District Court ordered Iran to pay more than $10.5 billion in damages to families of people killed in the attacks and to a group of insurers.\n\nIt seems that Iran and Hezbollah not only provided terrorist travel assistance for the 9/11 hijackers to travel through Iran to attend Afghan terror training camps, but also that Hezbollah operatives – traveled with the 9/11 hijackers in and out of Lebanon and in and out of Iran after these same hijackers had been issued visas to visit the United States.\n\nThe trial also revealed that bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Hezbollah’s Imad Mughniyeh – assassinated in 2008 – and other Iranian attaches had met in Sudan to establish an alliance supporting terrorism. The same judge rejected a request from the families to obligate Saudi Arabia to pay compensation, claiming that there is no evidence that the kingdom funded the attacks.\n\nThe lawsuit detailed 274 instances of Iran’s alleged role in terror-funding and its cooperation with terror organizations such as al-Qaeda. For example, Iran and Hezbollah were implicated in efforts to train al-Qaeda members to blow up large buildings. This training resulted in the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.\n\nUS ignores Iran-Terror Connection\n\nSo the links between Iran and terrorist groups are not new or surprising, and the US has always monitored this relation and highlighted the links between the two. So why this was not an issue of discussion or a factor to be considered while the US administration was negotiating the Iran deal with the Iranian government? And why did the US media and analysts generally avoided mentioning the Qaeda-Iran links when the Iran deal was in the headlines, or even when the fight against Islamic terrorism picked up in Syria and Iraq?\n\nThe answer to these questions lay in the underlying assumption by the US administration that Iran could be contained through the Iran deal. It also stems from the belief that Iran is the more “moderate” Islam that could actually help with the fight against terrorism in the region. This coordination has been materialized in Iraq. In September 2015, the New York Times reported that the US and an Iran-backed militia are sharing a military base.\n\nThe problem with these two assumptions is that Iran has and will always use and manipulate all extremist groups in the world if that serves its interests. It has happened many times in the not-so-far past.\n\nIn February 2012, the US Department of the Treasury designated the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) for its “support to terrorist groups, such as Al-Qaeda and Al-Qaeda in Iraq… again exposing the extent of Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism as a matter of Iran’s state policy”.\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed by the US officials, that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith (Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law), and who was captured in Turkey, has spent most of a decade in Iran, in some sort of confinement.\n\nThen in 2015, the Pentagon announced that Muhsin al-Fadhli, an al Qaeda operative who had been wanted for more than a decade, was killed in an airstrike in Syria. Before relocating to Syria, Fadhli led al Qaeda’s network in Iran. The Treasury Department had already revealed this fact in a terrorist designation issued October 18, 2012. According to Treasury, “Fadhli began working with al Qaeda’s Iran-based facilitation network in 2009 and was later arrested by the Iranians.” But he was “released by the Iranians in 2011 and went on to assume the leadership of the facilitation network.”\n\nApparently there was a deal between Iran and Al-Qaeda on Fadhli’s activities, which requires al Qaeda’s to report to the regime. “Under the terms of the agreement between al Qaeda and Iran, al Qaeda must refrain from conducting any operations within Iranian territory and recruiting operatives inside Iran while keeping Iranian authorities informed of their activities.” “In return” for accepting Iran’s terms, Treasury continued, “the Government of Iran gave the Iran-based al Qaeda network freedom of operation and uninhibited ability to travel for extremists and their families.”\n\nThese above incidents are but some of a number of episodes that indicate that Iran frequently coordinated with Al-Qaeda, and also that Al-Qaeda enjoyed a safe haven in Iran, albeit with conditions. We don’t have considerable indicators of this cooperation after 2015, but that doesn’t mean that Iran has broken its ties with al-Qaeda. No proof of that has been provided.\n\nMeanwhile, as a Iran still refuses to pay to the families of the 9/11 victims, the US and Iran signed the historical Iran Deal which not only will boost Iran’s economy after the release of the sanctions, but also gives Iran a green card to do whatever it needs in the region, in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere. Any discussion of this during the media and political debate in the US over the nuclear deal with Iran was lacking, even though al Qaeda’s presence on Iranian soil could potentially obstruct his vision of a post-deal world, where Iran joins the world diplomacy and stops its terrorism operations in the region.\n\nEven after the Manhattan ruling that reveals that Iran has assisted Al-Qaeda in the attack of 9/11, little has been done by the administration to dig into these ties or provide evidence of whether they’re still going on or not. The 9/11 Commission admitted back then that several of the hijackers had transited Iran, and that Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, the jihadist entrepreneur who came up with the Planes Operation, had hid his family in Iran for years. Instead of conducting further investigations, President Obama went ahead with the Iranian deal, still insisting that the nuclear deal is part of security realignment in the Gulf.\n\nOf course this is not a simple act of negligence. Any attempt to hold Iran responsible for the 9/11 attack, or even digging deeper, would jeopardize Obama’s “legacy” to strike the deal. Despite all the evidence and facts, the decision to not seek this further was a political decision. The nuclear deal was a priority and everything else will be put on hold.\n\nNuclear Deal Leaves Iran Stronger and More Dangerous\n\nNow that the deal is done and Iran is still allowed to commit horrible atrocities in Syria and elsewhere, through its proxies such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Al-Hashd el-Sha’bi, it seems the issue for this administration is beyond the Iran deal when it comes to Iran and the region. In an interview with Jeffry Goldberg earlier this year, Obama indicated that the Iran Deal was mainly to make a dangerous country less dangerous. But let’s look at the facts and see if Iran has actually become less dangerous.\n\nAfter the deal, Iran strengthened its control over Lebanon and Iraq, while is still permitted to besiege town in Syria, cause starvation, and force people out of the their homes and villages. With a very clear green light from the West, the UN and Russia, Iran is sending foreign Shiite fighters from Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and wherever is needed, to strengthen its control over the “useful Syria” – that is the corridor that stretches from the coast, through Homs, Damascus, Qalamoun and all the way up to the Lebanese borders.\n\nBut these foreign fighters, who are committing the same atrocities as other terrorism groups in Syria and Iraq, do not seem to be a problem to the US. Meanwhile, the hardliners in Iran are getting more vicious in their rhetoric, and way more controlling and brutal in their policies and behavior, internally and in the region.\n\nIran did not get less dangerous. On the contrary, it is not a more hazardous force in the region, with more militias than it had ever controlled. Did the nuclear program disappear? Certainly not. It’s just on hold. In any case, the nuclear program was never the goal for Iran. It was the means to reach regional control and that is exactly what Iran has achieved?\n\nSo the question now is, is it time to start holding Iran responsible for its terrorism and assistance of terrorists? When Iran begins to see the consequences of its assistance of terrorist, its atrocities in the region, and its crimes against humanity in general, then maybe it will start to realize the limitations to its unrealistic ambitions. When Iran starts paying for its crimes then probably the internal change will actually be realized. However, giving Iran a free hand in the region is not going to weaken Iran’s hardliners. If they win the region, they win everything, and that’s not going to make Iran less dangerous.\n\n*Hanin Ghaddar is a Friedmann Visiting Fellow at the Washington Institute for the Near East Policy.

Eventually, Alzheimer’s kills brain cells and takes people’s lives.\n\nCAUSES\n\nWhat causes Alzheimer’s? We still aren’t sure. “For 1% of all cases, there are three genes that determine definitively whether or not you will have Alzheimer’s, and all three relate to amyloid-beta production, which in these cases is likely the cause of Alzheimer’s,” says Dr. Gad Marshall, associate medical director of clinical trials at the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “For the other 99%, amyloid and tau are closely associated with Alzheimer’s, but many things may contribute to the development of symptoms, such as inflammation in the brain, vascular risk factors, and lifestyle.”\n\nIMPROVE YOUR LIFESTYLE\n\nHealthy habits may help ward off Alzheimer’s. Consider the following steps.\n\nExercise. “The most convincing evidence is that physical exercise helps prevent the development of Alzheimer’s or slow the progression in people who have symptoms,” says Dr. Marshall. “The recommendation is 30 minutes of moderately vigorous aerobic exercise, three to four days per week.”\n\nEat a Mediterranean diet. “This has been shown to help thwart Alzheimer’s or slow its progression. A recent study showed that even partial adherence to such a diet is better than nothing, which is relevant to people who may find it difficult to fully adhere to a new diet,” says Dr. Marshall. The diet includes fresh vegetables and fruits; whole grains; olive oil; nuts; legumes; fish; moderate amounts of poultry, eggs, and dairy; moderate amounts of red wine; and red meat only sparingly.\n\nGet enough sleep. “Growing evidence suggests that improved sleep can help prevent Alzheimer’s and is linked to greater amyloid clearance from the brain,” says Dr. Marshall. Aim for seven to eight hours per night.\n\nNOT AS CERTAIN\n\nWe have some—but not enough—evidence that the following lifestyle choices help prevent Alzheimer’s.\n\nLearn new things. “We think that cognitively stimulating activities may be helpful in preventing Alzheimer’s, but the evidence for their benefit is often limited to improvement in a learned task, such as a thinking skills test, that does not generalize to overall improvement in thinking skills and activities of daily living,” says Dr. Marshall.\n\nConnect socially. “We think that greater social contact helps prevent Alzheimer’s,” explains Dr. Marshall, but so far, “there is only information from observational studies.”\n\nDrink—but just a little. There is conflicting evidence about the benefit of moderate alcohol intake (one drink per day for women, one or two for men) and reduced risk of Alzheimer’s. “It is thought that wine in particular, and not other forms of alcohol, may be helpful, but this has not been proved,” says Dr. Marshall.\n\nWHAT YOU SHOULD DO\n\nEven though we don’t have enough evidence that all healthy lifestyle choices prevent Alzheimer’s, we do know they can prevent other chronic problems. For example, limiting alcohol intake can help reduce the risk for certain cancers, such as breast cancer. Best advice: make as many healthy lifestyle choices as you can. “They’re all beneficial, and if they help you avoid Alzheimer’s, all the better,” says Dr. Marshall.\n\nKNOW THE SYMPTOMS OF ALZHEIMER’S\n\nForgetting where you parked your car can be annoying. If it happens all the time, it can be disturbing, and you may worry that it’s a sign of a more serious condition. But don’t panic. There’s a difference between normal age-related memory slips, such as forgetting where the car keys are, and more serious signs of memory loss, such as forgetting what car keys are used for.\n\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include frequent memory loss, confusion about locations, taking longer to accomplish normal daily tasks, trouble handling money and paying bills, loss of spontaneity, and mood and personality changes. “If you have a decline in your memory or thinking that affects your ability to perform any of your daily routines, ask your doctor for a screening to evaluate you for Alzheimer’s and related conditions,” says Dr. Gad Marshall, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor of neurology.", "title": "What Can You Do to Avoid Alzheimer's Disease?", "url": "http://eng.majalla.com/2017/01/article55252691/can-avoid-alzheimers-disease", "main": "http://eng.majalla.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Going to a four-day school week was another, along with such things as cutting arts and music programs, physical education and athletics.\n\nGarcia said SFPS is faced with the decision because state funding for public education is in doubt. The state Legislature approved a budget that would reduce funding to the district by about $1.5 million and “sweep” another $1.9 million from the district’s cash reserves. Gov. Susana Martinez vetoed the portion of the budget that funded higher education, so it’s unlikely the final budget will include increases for public schools.\n\n“The state is in serious, serious trouble and it’s impacting the schools,” she said.\n\nA decision has to be made soon, she said, because the school district’s budget for the 2017-2018 school year is due to be submitted to the state for approval at the end of next month.\n\nOther people wanted to know why E.J.

We dug a great hole and mixed the dirt with some compost, refilled the hole with the mixed-up dirt and watered some during the winter. Now it’s not leafing out as quickly as others in the neighborhood. Have we done something wrong? – A.G., West Side\n\nA: Struggling, huh? From your descriptions of everything you’ve done for the tree all sounds well except one thing: “a great hole.” Those words have me concerned! I’m thinking two things, one, the tree is just being slow because of its newness or your young ash tree has effectively sunk into that great hole and it’s now suffocating.\n\nI suggest you get down at ground level and inspect this youngster now as what you’re looking for is all visual. At the base of nearly all trees you can, upon training your eyes to recognize it, notice a wee flare to the trunk. In fact, that’s what this “out-dentation” is called, “the flare.” It’s actually a sometimes barely perceptible flaring of the trunk but it does exist. That flare is part of the breathing system of trees so it has to be exposed. The flare or collar needs to be set just at ground level when you plant. So by your digging such a great hole I am willing to bet the ash tree’s flare got buried or the creature actually did sink too far into the hole.\n\nWith that thought comes the fix. Since the tree is fairly newly planted, dig it up and start from scratch. Make sure that when you re-plant, the tree trunk – all of it – stays above ground level. You might have to backfill the hole some and tamp that soil down firmly to keep the tree from sinking again. Be sure to recreate a moat of at least 3 to 4 feet in diameter surrounding the tree. Consider applying a dose of root stimulator after the initial watering of the replanted ash, monitor its water needs throughout this growing season, and see if it rebounds.\n\nThe second fix isn’t as labor intensive but you’ll want to be careful, OK? At ground level, using a hand trowel, gently scrape soil away from the trunk exposing it. All of that dislodged soil needs to be removed from the well of the tree site. Place it on the outer wall of your moat to create a sturdier one. Your goal here is to make the area inside the well flat and level and the trunk gets exposed so the flare is perfectly even with the soil in the well. Boy, I hope that makes sense! Be sure to monitor the soil level periodically to be sure the flare isn’t re-buried as you water. Do scrape the soil away as needed to be sure the flare stays exposed, at ground level forever.\n\nHopefully, the tree isn’t too far gone that by exposing the flare it’ll be able to regroup, rebound and settle in (not sink mind you) so it’ll have a long and glorious life in your landscaping. I’m wishing the best for the recovery of your ash!\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading\n\nQ: I want to get my mom an Easter lily for the holiday but worry because she suffers from allergies. What can I do to brighten her day but not contribute to her allergies? – H.D., West Side\n\nA: Well, you’re in luck! Go ahead and get a beautiful blooming plant for mom and assure her it probably won’t affect her health. At the beginning of my nursery career, the company I worked for had a huge teaching promotion that “pretty flowers don’t cause allergies.” And for the most part, it’s true! It’s the plants that make “flowers” that we don’t recognize as flowers that are making her life miserable.

According to APS projections, the schedule, known as 7/6, would save about $3 million because the district can reduce its teacher workforce through attrition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading\n\nKing clarified that APS does not have to stick to the approved scenario and can still decide to maintain its current 7/5 schedule, which includes one period for preparation and one for departmental planning in groups called “Professional Learning Communities.”\n\nUnder the 7/6 plan, the PLC period would be cut.\n\n“We are hoping it won’t be a 2 percent (reduction), so we don’t have to do this,” King said. “But we are planning for that, and we asked the high schools to look at that.”\n\nLike other districts across the state, APS is awaiting a special legislative session that will determine the fiscal year 2018 budget.\n\nAdministrators have said they think a 2 percent cut is most likely, which amounts to $12.4 million for the district. In addition, APS is projecting higher expenses coupled with lower enrollment, adding up to another $13.7 million for a total loss of $26.1 million.\n\nAll the uncertainty is taking a toll.\n\nHigh school teachers and principals are “incredibly anxious” because they don’t know what to expect, according to Albuquerque Teachers Federation President Ellen Bernstein.\n\n“We’re so damn frustrated,” Bernstein said. “We have to plan for next year. We don’t have a choice.

Bernstein thinks, optimally, the process should have started a month or two ago.\n\nIf the 7/6 schedule does return, teachers will be very disappointed, according to Tanya Kuhnee, a West Mesa High School English teacher and ATF high school vice president.\n\nThe union fought hard to bring back the PLC period when the district cut it for the for 2015-16 school year, helping organize a committee of teachers, students, parents and principals to consider alternatives. After months of work, they successfully argued for the 7/5 format.\n\nAs part of the union campaign, dozens of teachers spoke out at a board meeting, describing exhaustion and burnout as they struggled to cover six classes.\n\n“That will happen again if 7/6 comes back,” Kuhnee said.\n\nLast week, Kuhnee met with a group of teachers to brainstorm cost savings ideas that would allow the district to maintain the five class load.\n\nThe entire process has been stressful, Kuhnee said.\n\nAPS has already absorbed a $25 million reduction for fiscal year 2017 across two rounds of cuts.\n\nFor fiscal year 2018, APS is considering class size increases and work-day reductions for all employees. On Thursday, the budget steering committee decided to ax middle school sports.\n\n“All of the VPs in the union have teachers coming to their rooms, crying with them after school because they are so worried about all of the different proposals from the district,” Kuhnee said. “At this point, we are talking about people’s livelihoods, and their ability to support their families.”", "title": "APS class schedule remains in limbo", "url": "https://www.abqjournal.com/988171/aps-class-schedule-remains-in-limbo.html", "main": "https://www.abqjournal.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

So they’re locking in, and they expect to keep ramping up production and drilling and putting people back to work,” said Andrew Dittmar, a senior analyst with Houston-based energy research firm PLS Inc.\n\nThe value of land in the Permian Basin, which includes stretches along the Texas-New Mexico border, also has increased rapidly because of the continued interest. Acreage in New Mexico is now going for twice the amount companies paid back in September, Dittmar said.\n\nNew Mexico also led the nation last week in the number of new rigs added to the count, and state officials have been pulling in record earnings during monthly lease sales. The State Land Office is on track to exceed projections for this fiscal year by tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThe uptick in the industry can’t come soon enough as development in oil- and gas-rich corners of the state contribute about one-third of the revenues New Mexico uses each year to pay for education, public safety and other government services.\n\nBattered by the downturn in commodity prices and a sluggish economy, state coffers have yet to feel the full effects of the new investments.\n\n“The fact is oil and gas is the most important industry for the state from an economic and jobs perspective,” said Ryan Flynn, head of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. “When oil and gas is doing well, New Mexico is thriving. When oil and gas is hurting, New Mexico hurts.”\n\nIn southeastern New Mexico, communities have learned to weather the ebb and flow of oil prices. Hobbs Mayor Sam Cobb said Monday that revenues from gross receipts taxes dropped by about 40 percent during the downturn, but his city had squirreled away funds during the previous peak.\n\nWith Hobbs sitting at the edge of one of the country’s most prolific basins, Cobb is optimistic.\n\n“The Permian has all of the right pieces in terms of the logistics, access to labor, year-round operational capacity, all those things. I think if we can continue to maintain a public policy regarding the export side, we’ll continue to see growth in the region,” he said.\n\nIn northwestern New Mexico, local leaders are excited about Houston-based Hilcorp Energy Co.’s decision to buy up to $3 billion in natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips. They see it as a shot in the arm for a region facing uncertainty over the future of two coal-fired power plants and the mines that fuel them.\n\nAnalysts and others say the deep pockets of the companies that are now invested in New Mexico will play a role in the longevity of this latest wave of activity.\n\n“They’re all companies that have reputations. When they move into an area, they have plans that stretch years out,” Dittmar said. “When they decide to make a move, they’re determined and they follow through. So we expect that there’s decades worth of activity to be had there.”", "title": "New Mexico assets capture attention of oil and gas giants", "url": "https://www.abqjournal.com/989592/new-mexico-assets-capture-attention-of-oil-and-gas-giants.html", "main": "https://www.abqjournal.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

On the other side, those with low scores may benefit from the removal of civil judgments, medical debts and tax liens as factors.\n\nBeyond determining whether someone gets approved for a credit card, a credit score can affect what interest rate and what spending limit are offered.\n\nThe new method is being implemented later this year by VantageScore, a company created by the credit bureaus Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. It’s not as well-known as Fair Isaac Corp., whose FICO score is used for the vast majority of mortgages. But VantageScore handled 8 billion account applications last year, so if you applied for a credit card, that score was likely used to approve or deny you.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading\n\nUsing what’s known as trended data is the biggest change. The phrase means credit scores will take into account the trajectory of a borrower’s debts on a month-to-month basis. So a person who is paying down debt is now likely to be scored better than a person who is making minimum monthly payments but has been slowly accumulating credit card debt.\n\n“This is a really big deal,” said John Ulzheimer, an expert in credit reports and credit scoring. Ulzheimer said taking trended data into account has long been considered by the credit score industry, but hasn’t been implemented on a meaningful scale. He expects more lenders to adopt it.\n\nPeople with high credit scores may be affected the most, since the goal of trended data is to see warning signs long before a borrower actually gets into serious trouble.\n\n“When it comes to prime borrowers, you may not have bad behavior on your credit file, but a trajectory provides very powerful information,” said Sarah Davies, senior vice president for research, analytics and product development at VantageScore.\n\nThe change also shakes up the maxim that had people keeping open accounts they’d opened long ago. An important metric in calculating credit scores has been the portion of their available credit people are actually using. A person with $5,000 in credit card debt with a $50,000 limit across several cards could score better than someone with $2,000 in debt on a $10,000 limit because of that ratio.\n\nBut VantageScore will now mark a borrower negatively for having excessively large credit card limits, on the theory that the person could run up a high credit card debt quickly. Those who have prime credit scores may be hurt the most, since they are most likely to have multiple cards open. But those who like to play the credit card rewards program points game could be affected as well.\n\nTaking civil judgments, medical debts and tax liens out of the equation comes after a 2015 agreement between the three credit bureaus and 31 state attorneys general. The argument was that civil judgments and tax liens –which can significantly hurt a person’s credit score — were often full of errors. Medical debt was being reported on a person’s credit report before there was time for insurance to reimburse.\n\nPeople with those items on their credit reports now could see a bump of as much as 20 points. But it won’t help much if they also have negative marks like delinquencies and debts that have gone to collection.\n\nMortgages, though, won’t be affected. The government-owned mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require a FICO score for eligibility. Because of their outsized influence on the market, few mortgage lenders use VantageScore.\n\n___\n\nKen Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

UNM will host the 2020 Division I indoor track and field national championships, and future golf and cross country regionals, it learned.\n\nBut it also learned that of the 48 sites for both first- and second-round and regional play in 2019-22, the university’s bid to host any of them was turned down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading\n\nKrebs said in a statement that the university put in a competitive bid and is “extremely disappointed” not to have been selected for NCAA men’s basketball.\n\nAnd this time, Krebs said the NCAA gave feedback on what the problem is: The Pit doesn’t have the floor space the NCAA is now seeking.\n\nKrebs said the renovations to the Pit at a cost of some $60 million and completed in 2010 “addressed many things relating to the NCAA Tournament, (but) the decision to install custom courts has really hampered our ability to host the tournaments. The concrete surrounding the playing floor limits the required space needed, and while that closeness of the fans to the court is what gives us a great home-court advantage, it does not meet the needs of the NCAA.”\n\nThis marks the third consecutive bid cycle that UNM has been turned down, following a bid in 2011 for 2013-15 and one in 2014 for 2016-18.\n\nMike Haggerty, assistant AD for events, said previous feedback pointed to the “number of competitive bids and the volume of bidders” and that this was the first mention of lack of available space around the playing surface as a defined detriment.\n\nSome of the issues the NCAA addressed were specific:\n\nn The NCAA court would need to be specially cut in all four corners to fit the space available due to existing concrete staircases to the floor.\n\nn The courts need a minimum of 122 feet from end to end for the placing of the basketball stanchions. Due to the concrete at each end of the arena, the space available is 117 feet. NCAA specs also call for 17 feet from the baseline to the first row of seating behind the goals. The concrete baseline seating prohibits that possibility.\n\nn The NCAA prohibits double-stacking the team benches, meaning all 18 seats must go in a single row. That means one team bench would extend into the ramp and on an incline. There also is not the required mandated walking areas behind the scorer’s table due to the permanent seating located around the court.\n\nn Due to the concrete end seating, the required 3-foot safety runoff for the players on each side of the stanchion would have been compromised to fit photographers, cheer squads and other game personnel.\n\nn Special cuts in the court also would be needed to fit the scorer’s table. Also, due to the four electrical panels on each sideline running near the court, special cuts in the court are required.\n\nUNM won bids to host regionals for cross country in 2020, for men’s golf in 2021, and women’s golf in 2022.

By the evening, “The O’Reilly Factor” no longer bore his name, simply titled “The Factor.”\n\nThe downfall of Fox’s most popular — and most lucrative — personality began with an April 2 report in The New York Times that five women had been paid a total of $13 million to keep quiet about disturbing encounters with O’Reilly, who continued to deny any wrongdoing in a statement hours after he was fired. Dozens of his show’s advertisers fled within days, even though O’Reilly’s viewership increased.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading\n\nO’Reilly’s exit came nine months after his former boss, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, was ousted following allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nFollowing the Times story, 21st Century Fox said it had asked the same law firm that investigated Ailes to look into O’Reilly’s behavior. 21st Century Fox leaders Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James said in a memo to Fox staff that their decision to ax O’Reilly came following an “extensive review” into the charges.\n\n“I understand how difficult this has been for many of you,” Rupert Murdoch said in a memo to Fox staff.\n\nO’Reilly, denied a chance to say goodbye to his Fox viewers, did so via a statement.\n\n“It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,” he said. “But that is the unfortunate reality that many of us in the public eye must live with today. I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers.”\n\nO’Reilly’s dismissal doesn’t signal any change of direction for the network: Fox said conservative pundit Tucker Carlson would move into O’Reilly’s time slot — the second time in three months he’s replaced an exiting prime-time personality. Carlson, a veteran who has hosted shows on CNN, MSNBC and PBS, had taken over for Megyn Kelly in January when she announced she was moving to NBC News. “The Five,” a talk show with five rotating hosts that regularly airs at 5 p.m. ET, will move into the 9 p.m. time slot. Eric Bolling will host a new show that airs at 5 p.m. starting next month, the company said.\n\nDana Perino, who had been subbing for O’Reilly who had been on vacation for the past few days, acknowledged his departure at the top of “The Factor.” At the end of the show, she paid him a warm tribute.\n\nNoting the “dramatic changes,” Perino said: “It is the end of the era . Bill has been the undisputed king of cable news, and for good reason.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading\n\nShe also noted his devoted fans and their loyalty to the show.\n\nO’Reilly, 67, had ruled the “no spin zone” on television with a quick smile and an even quicker temper. He pushed a populist, conservative-leaning point of view born from growing up on Long Island, and was quick to shout down those who disagreed with him. Fans loved his willingness to talk back to power or point out hypocrisy among liberal politicians or media members.\n\nO’Reilly and President Donald Trump are both “crowd-pleasing showmen who know how to signal to loyalists in their audience that they are not taking themselves quite as seriously as their detractors are,” said news consultant Andrew Tyndall. “Half of the fun that they have with their audiences comes from watching the outrage that they manage to provoke.”\n\n“What Rush Limbaugh was to talk radio, Bill O’Reilly has been to conservative television,” said Mark Feldstein, communication professor at the University of Maryland. “You can’t underestimate the influence and the profits that he brought into Fox News for all these years and that’s why they hesitated so long in doing the right thing.”\n\nHis show generated $178 million in advertising revenue in 2015, according to Kantar Media. Before the advertising boycott, there was the prospect of even more: his audience was larger in the first three months of 2017 than it has ever been. With a profit center gone, 21st Century Fox stock fell almost 1 percent Wednesday in heavy trading.\n\nO’Reilly’s pugnacious personality wasn’t just an onscreen affectation, with one of the settlements going to a woman who complained about being shouted at in the newsroom. O’Reilly was alleged to have slowed the careers of women who spurned his advances. One former Fox personality, Juliet Huddy, said she pulled away and fell to the ground when he tried to kiss her, and he didn’t help her up, the Times reported.\n\nOne harassment case, from a former producer who said O’Reilly called her and described sexual fantasies and appeared to be masturbating, dated back more than a decade and was widely reported then. While O’Reilly survived then, the accumulation of cases outlined in the Times damaged him much more extensively. For Fox executives, it wasn’t clear when it would end: a campaign to target advertisers was continuing, a group of women demonstrated in front of Fox’s headquarters Tuesday and another woman, a former clerical worker at Fox, called a harassment hotline and accusing the host of boorish behavior.\n\nSome of O’Reilly’s critics were happy with the news.\n\nAuthor Stephen King tweeted: “New book by Fox News: Killing Bill O’Reilly.” It referred to O’Reilly’s series of best-selling books on the deaths of major historical figures.\n\n“Mission accomplished,” said Keith Olbermann, who frequently tweaked O’Reilly on an MSNBC show that competed in the same time slot for several years. Olbermann said that when he was working at Fox Sports in 1999, he helped a friend get a job at Fox News. She quit the job — and the business — due to her treatment by O’Reilly, he said.\n\n“This has been going on for decades and I hope his having to go out in shame and disgrace makes things just a little bit better for her and all his victims right now,” he said. “Certainly they make things better for America.”\n\nBut many of O’Reilly’s fans took to social media to express their unhappiness at losing their hero. Several suggested that Fox had essentially caved to a left wing campaign. It didn’t help that the controversy was set in motion by the Times, a publication hated in conservative circles.\n\nO’Reilly’s lawyers said he was the victim of an orchestrated campaign by liberal organizations like Media Matters for America, which contacted his advertisers to pressure them to leave the show. Conservative personality Glenn Beck — who once lost a job at Fox because a similar campaign choked his program of paying advertisers — came to O’Reilly’s defense on his radio show.\n\n“You need to write and call Fox News Channel today and tell them, you can lose your advertisers or you can lose your viewers,” Beck said on his radio show hours before the firing. “But you have to put some spine back into the Murdoch family and the Fox News Channel board because you are about to lose Bill O’Reilly.”\n\nHe was too late.\n\nO’Reilly is also one of the country’s most popular nonfiction authors. The books in his “Killing” historical series, including “Killing Lincoln” and “Killing Reagan,” have consistently sold 1 million or more copies in hardcover, a rare achievement in publishing, and his platform on Fox enabled him to promote his work. He has also had best-sellers with everything from the memoir “A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity” to his most recent work, “Old School,” which includes passages urging the respectful treatment of women.\n\nO’Reilly and co-author Martin Dugard are due to release another book in the “Killing” series in September, and a spokeswoman for publisher Henry Holt and Co. said that plans had not changed.\n\nVatican spokesman Greg Burke confirmed O’Reilly was in the VIP section for the pope’s Wednesday appearance. Burke, a former Fox News correspondent in Rome, denied having facilitated the tickets. Such tickets can be obtained via special request to the papal household from embassies, high-ranking churchmen or Vatican officials.\n\nFrancis always swings by the VIP seats at the end of his audience for a quick round of handshakes. A photographer from the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano snapped a photo of Francis reaching out to shake his hand.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Nicole Winfield in Rome; Hillel Italie and Marley Jay in New York; and Lynn Elber in Los Angeles contributed to this story.", "title": "Fox News Channel dismisses O’Reilly, its biggest star", "url": "https://www.abqjournal.com/990122/oreillys-bosses-not-commenting-on-reports-that-hes-out.html", "main": "https://www.abqjournal.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Photograph: Jan M. Olsen/AP\n\nKhalida Popal has paid a high price for becoming the face of the Afghanistan women’s football team. “Sometimes I still have nightmares,” she says quietly. “Those men are standing and looking at me and laughing or there is the fear that they will rape me.”\n\nIt is six years since Khalida had to leave her family and her homeland, terrified for her life and personal safety, after pioneering women’s football in a country that has been described as one of the most dangerous places to be female.\n\nKhalida had been taught to play the sport as a young girl by her PE teacher mother, who instilled the belief that football and sport were not only fun but empowering and good for her. That, however, was not a view many shared in a country that had until recently been run by the Taliban. From opposition in schools to name-calling in streets, Khalida saw early on the challenges she was facing.\n\nAs her campaign for more girls to be allowed to play grew she faced objections from across the board. Some were fathers and sons, who did not think their daughters and sisters should be playing football and called those who did “prostitutes” and “bitches” for compromising the honor of their family and their culture. Other critics were more highly connected.\n\nWith the growth of her profile, the success of the team and a position in the national football association she became an increasingly visible target. Garbage was thrown at her as she walked down the street, violent threats snarled in her face as well as sinister phone calls compromising not only her own safety but those close to her.\n\nShe recalls: “My problem was not the Taliban with the gun, it was also the Taliban with the tie, the suit and the boots, people with the mentality of the Taliban who were against women and their voice.”\n\nEventually she knew she had no choice. “I thought I have to leave otherwise I would be shot. I decided overnight. I didn’t tell anyone I was going, just my father and my mother. It was a very tough time. I didn’t know what to pack. I didn’t know when I would come back or where I would end up. I just took my bag with my computer and one picture of the team. I didn’t take my football kit. I took nothing else.\n\n“I didn’t have time to get in touch with my team-mates, they didn’t know why I suddenly disappeared. I didn’t tell them exactly what had happened to me for a very long time, I didn’t want them to feel scared, I didn’t want them to give up because they always saw me as a leader, a powerful person who stood up for them.”\n\nShe left Kabul and made her way to India, where she lived under the radar for months: constantly on the move and terrified of being found and sent back to Afghanistan as she had no visa. Incredibly she still managed to organize a match for the national team, reassuring them that everything was fine, despite her sudden disappearance.\n\nEventually she managed to make her way to an asylum center in Norway and from there to another center in Denmark, where after nearly a year in a camp she was finally granted residency.\n\nWhile she was waiting in the camp, not knowing what her future held, the enormity of everything she had been through finally caught up with her.\n\n“I was not the woman I used to be. I said to myself so many times, I didn’t risk my life to end up in an asylum centre in Denmark; it was not the goal. I felt like a bird in a cage. I was very depressed. I stopped talking to anyone, I had those dreams where someone is coming, I was dreaming that they sent me back. I missed my team – those girls I could hear their voices calling my name and laughing. It was really tough for me.”\n\nThe opportunity to play for a local team failed to be the breakthrough she had hoped for when she suffered a career-ending knee injury. “Suddenly I was losing everything. I’d lost my country, my identity, I was in an asylum center, I’d lost my family, I couldn’t play. I felt like a doll hanging in the air. I could not fly in the sky and I could not come to the ground.”\n\nWith the help of a psychiatrist and antidepressants she gradually came to terms with the changes in her life. She started swimming and cycling. Working with other women in the camps she encouraged them to use sport to make themselves feel better, to have a focus and to try to think of something other than the situation they were in. As a result she set up her own organization – Girl Power.\n\n“Even when I was sick in the asylum center I saw women who had worse situations than me and I wanted to save them. I was taking them out for walks and I had a football and told them: ‘Just kick the ball.’ They would be running after the ball, kicking it with bare legs and sandals.”\n\nGirl Power finds volunteer instructors in all sports to work with the refugees and to build a bridge between them and the local Danish residents. “Sport is a great tool to break the ice and to help women gain self-confidence,” she explains.\n\nKhalida’s new life has helped her spot talent from refugee camps for the Afghanistan football team that she still helps run. She has also recruited American coaches who have played at the top level of women’s football and until recently they trained in the US. “We cannot continue in America because the president is against Muslims and refugees,” she says, unfazed. ““If those people inside my country, those haters, couldn’t stop me, Donald Trump or [even] a hundred Trumps will never stop me,” she says with a defiant smile. So she is already organizing a training session in Asia for later in the year.\n\nLast year she worked with Hummel, the Danish sportswear manufacturer that supports the Afghan teams, to design the first hijab that could be worn to play football. “It was to change the mindset, sport is not against any religion or culture. It is a way to tell families that we respect your beliefs, it was to give an opportunity to girls who want to wear a hijab and play football.”\n\nLast week, to mark International Women’s Day, her work was acknowledged by Theirworld, the global education charity founded by Sarah Brown, as part of their campaign #RewritingTheCode. Khalida, now 29, was given the 2017 Challenge Award. The aim of the campaign is to challenge all the embedded prejudices that prevent women and girls from achieving equality.\n\n“My message for rewriting the code is women are not for being at home or washing dishes,” she smiles. “They can play football. It should be a choice.”\n\nThere really is no stopping her. Her eyes glow as she talks about how she felt wearing her national shirt, touching the badge and hearing the anthem knowing the struggle she and her team faced to get there. “I am happy that I am still involved in women’s football and happy that I can still do something for my country miles away. I played as a defender. That is my thing, my personality – to defend women, to defend my team, to defend my gender.”\n\nMeanwhile, she is about to start a degree course in sports management and has set her sights on a job with the UN or FIFA. She has already told the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, how she believes equality could be brought to the international arena.\n\n“I think pay should be equal for male and female players. That is what I told the president. I looked into his eyes and said: ‘Whenever you take a decision think about the father who has a son and a daughter when he is out shopping for his kids. He always wants to buy the same-value thing for both of them because he knows otherwise there will be a fight at home. Think like a father.’ He was laughing and said: ‘Yes, I will do that.’”\n\nHaving been supported by her own parents at every stage of her incredible journey Khalida’s love and respect for her mother and father, who have now joined her in Denmark, is immense. “I don’t know if I will ever have children but if I have a daughter I will let her decide what she wants to be. I will buy the toys she wants. I will not tell her ‘you are a girl this toy belongs to you’, this one doesn’t. I will give her a football and a doll and let her decide.\n\n“I am a woman, I have to be proud of being a woman. This is my identity. In order to make people respect you, you have to understand and respect who you are and what you are.”\n\nThe unstoppable force of Khalida Popal.\n\n(The Guardian)", "title": "Khalida Popal, Afghanistan Football Pioneer: ‘If the Haters Couldn’t Stop Me, Trump Can’t’", "url": "http://english.aawsat.com/louise-court/lifestyle-culture/sports/khalida-popal-afghanistan-football-pioneer-haters-couldnt-stop-trump-cant", "main": "http://english.aawsat.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

This sprawling, suburban area in the hills has cooler temperatures than elsewhere in the region. It is also one of the country’s most affluent areas, with upscale restaurants and shops, and a few foreign embassies and consulates.\n\nThe three-level, 8,772-square-foot house, designed by Ronald Zürcher, a local architect, was built about 15 years ago on nearly three-quarters of an acre in a quiet neighborhood. “It’s a very calm area — you don’t get a lot of traffic,” said the listing agent, Eva Murillo of Costa Rica Sotheby’s International Real Estate. “But the house is minutes away from just about everything. It’s close to the airport. There’s a hospital nearby, a big shopping mall and schools.”\n\nThe owners, who are downsizing, incorporated many natural materials into the construction. The large wooden front door was imported from India and is surrounded by a stone archway from a Guatemalan church. Other stone, brick and wood accents can be found throughout the home.\n\nInside, on the main floor, is a spacious tile foyer that leads to the living room, which has a wood-burning fireplace; to the brick-ceilinged dining room; and to a breakfast area and a kitchen with stainless-steel appliances and granite counters. These rooms all have hardwood floors and wood-beamed ceilings, and connect to an expansive terrace that overlooks lush tropical gardens. Separate maid’s quarters are off the kitchen, and there is also a wine cellar.\n\nThe ground floor has a large recreation room with glass doors that open to the landscaped yard, which has a pool and a wooden yoga deck with seating. There is a two-car garage and an attached carport that can shelter four additional vehicles.\n\nThe four bedrooms are on the top floor. The en-suite master has a walk-in closet and a balcony offering city views in the distance. Two other bedrooms share a bathroom, while another has its own. All furnishings are available for purchase separately.\n\n“The social areas are great for entertaining,” Ms. Murillo said, “but the bedroom area is very private.”\n\nEscazú, officially San Miguel de Escazú, is part of the canton, or subdivision, of Escazú (population, around 60,000) in the province of San José. It is about 12 miles from Juan Santamaría International Airport in San José. The nearest beaches, on the Pacific side, are around 90 minutes away by car. But the area makes up for that in big-city conveniences: It is home to the giant shopping complex Multiplaza Escazú and close to one of the country’s best private medical facilities, Hospital Cima.\n\nMARKET OVERVIEW\n\nCosta Rica’s housing market was booming for nearly a decade, but activity stalled after the 2008 global financial crisis. In the last couple of years, business has started picking up again, although “prices are still fairly affordable compared to what they were before 2008,” said Saul Rasminsky, the owner of Dominical Real Estate, in the town of Dominical.\n\n“We’ve seen more buyers and a lot of deals,” Mr. Rasminsky said. “People are also developing land again — there are new condos being built. There’s more confidence in the market.”\n\nDemand for houses in Escazú remains generally healthy, too, Ms. Murillo said, because the area “is close to downtown for people who work, and close to Highway 27, which takes you to the beach.”\n\nPrices in Escazú range from about $150,000 for a small house at a low elevation, Ms. Murillo said, to around $6 million for an estate high up in the hills. But prices are now flat, she added, with some of the more expensive houses lingering on the market.\n\nWHO BUYS IN COSTA RICA\n\nAmericans dominate the second-home market, thanks in part to an abundance of direct flights to Costa Rica from many major cities in the United States. There is also strong interest from Canadian and European buyers, agents say.\n\nThe majority of foreign buyers prefer the country’s numerous beach communities along the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. “They come here to vacation, fall in love and want to buy,” said Rodolfo Herrera, a real estate lawyer and licensed notary based in San Isidro, San José.\n\nBuyers in the province of San José, and particularly in Escazú — which Mr. Herrera likens to a cosmopolitan American city such as Miami — are mostly people who have business in the capital, along with retirees or people close to retiring who are looking to move to a temperate climate.\n\n“The people who buy in Escazú want to have modern conveniences near the city,” Mr. Rasminsky said. “They want to live in an area where the temperatures are cooler and where they have mountain views.”\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nInternational home buyers in Costa Rica face few restrictions, Mr. Herrera said, but local financing is harder to come by and at less attractive terms than in the United States. Nonresident buyers, he said, should be prepared to pay in cash or obtain loans elsewhere.\n\nBuyers typically make a deposit (usually around 10 percent of the purchase price) into an escrow account. A period of due diligence follows to allow for a title search and a check for liens or encumbrances, among other things. Costa Rica has a reliable national property registry that tracks these records, and includes information on the owners, Mr. Herrera said.\n\nAgents recommend hiring an experienced real estate lawyer who is also a notary. The notary handles the all-important transfer of the deed to the property. (In Costa Rica, all licensed notaries are lawyers, but not all lawyers are notaries.) A common practice among foreign buyers is to form a corporation to purchase property. Purchases can also be made through a retirement fund like an individual retirement account, or I.R.A.\n\nWEBSITES\n\nCosta Rica tourism: visitcostarica.com\n\nTourism Board: ict.go.cr\n\nLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIES\n\nSpanish; colón ($1 = 560 colón). The American dollar is widely accepted.\n\nTAXES AND FEES\n\nThe seller usually pays the brokerage commission, which ranges from around 5 to 8 percent of the purchase price. The buyer typically pays most of the closing costs, Mr. Herrera said, which amount to at least 4 percent of the purchase price; costs include notary fees, title transfer tax and government stamps.\n\nProperty taxes in Costa Rica are generally very low, around 0.25 percent of the registered property value. The municipal taxes on this house are about $2,000 a year, Ms. Murillo said, in addition to an annual luxury tax of around $2,000.\n\nThe New York Times", "title": "House Hunting in ...

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nNorth Korea’s Foreign Minister yearns for the former US President Barack Obama. He said in his latest statement that through his tweets and statements, President Donald Trump seems evil. Iran’s Supreme Leader shares the same feeling and believes Trump’s presidency is a bad turn of events.\n\nWhen the US President warned Iran against “playing with fire”, Ayatollah Khamenei challenged Trump saying his statements didn’t scare him. This was before the Tomahawk missile strike on Shayrat airport in Syria.\n\nIt is only natural for the North Korean minister to feel sorry that Obama’s presidency is over. It was an eight-year snooze where evil regimes, like North Korea and Iran, enjoyed a relaxing period and developed their capabilities to expand at the expenses of other nations. The result was that the North dared to bomb Japan for the first time since World War II and developed its nuclear and missile weapons to a point where it became a horrific threat to the whole world.\n\nIran has taken over Syria and Iraq and is trying to do the same in Yemen.\n\nWashington is trying to protect her two main allies in the East: Japan and South Korea, and that is why it has sent its vice president to Seoul with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\n\nDespite its political weakness, US is still the strongest nation in the world with about 19 aircraft carriers, 10 of which are massive. Each of Russia and China only has one of those carriers.\n\nBut military strength alone is not enough. The US is fighting outside its territories and in front of countries that are geographically close. It is willing to sacrifice a million soldiers without any internal accountability.\n\nThis week, China increased its alertness and sent 150,000 soldiers to the border with its ally North Korea which also shares borders with Russia.\n\nGeopolitically, defending South Korea is a difficult mission. Its capital Seoul is only 30 kilometers away from the border of the northern evil neighbor which keeps threatening to bury the capital with its 11 million persons. That is why the US has created a demilitarized zone on the border with about 38,000 soldiers.\n\nI don’t want to dwell on the subject of the US-Korean struggle, but on the similar challenges it creates for the international community.\n\nNorth Korea is very much like Iran given that both countries are ruled by an ideology of comprehensive systems with most of their policies relying on building a massive regional force against neighbors.\n\nAt the time South Korea has developed socially and economically and became one of the world’s best countries in industry and technology, its neighbor in the Korean peninsula is in sordid poverty under the ruling of an obsessed man who spends all the country’s expenditure to develop his military aspirations.\n\nThe case is similar in Iran. The country is full of natural resources, just like its Gulf neighbors. But, instead of developing the country’s economy, Tehran’s regime chose to spend the government’s budget on establishing policies that are based on dominance and regional power.\n\nThe US wants to protect its regions of interests and powers, but during the Obama presidency, it deteriorated a lot.\n\nToday, Washington believes it should set boundaries for the Syrian and North Korean behavior. The US wants to send a direct message saying it is willing to defend its regions and interests against Russian and Chinese approaches.\n\nWe can’t forget that the US has been trying to improve its image as a strong nation since the September 11 attacks. But since then, it hasn’t achieved much. The war in Iraq was disastrously led, and then eight years went by during which the Obama administration faded. Today, Washington is faced by a world that is changing its borders and powers.\n\nAbdulrahman Al-Rashed Abdulrahman Al-Rashed is the former general manager of Al-Arabiya television.

REUTERS/Asmaa Waguih/Files\n\nCairo- Extremists in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula are cooperating and helping each other through money and arms transfers across several states in the region, security reports have said.\n\nAlthough they have dispersed after three years of attempts to establish their own “Emirate” in an area that lies between the border with the Gaza Strip and the outskirts of El-Arish city, the insurgency in the rugged, thinly populated Sinai has gained pace after the militants joined hands with extremists in El-Arish.\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat has received copies of the reports which reveal that among those extremists are Egyptians that had battled the authorities as part of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis group before establishing training camps in both Syria and Libya.\n\nMP Salameh Salem told the newspaper that “developments in Sinai cannot be separated from what’s happening in the rest of the region.”\n\nOther lawmakers have also expressed belief that ISIS members abroad are trying to offer a helping hand to the extremists in El-Arish that have formed a branch of ISIS terrorist organization.\n\n“Major powers are helping the fight against ISIS in Iraq, Syria and Libya but Egypt hasn’t received much assistance,” one MP was quoted as saying. “Terrorists have killed our troops and citizens in Sinai while the world stood by.”\n\nMP Rahmi Abedrabbuh told Asharq Al-Awsat that there seems to be a foreign support to shake the situation in Sinai. “Yet things will eventually be brought under control because armed forces are playing a huge role there.”\n\nSisi’s Speech at the Arab Summit\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said at the Arab League summit this week that the proliferation of terrorism has been one of the biggest challenges facing the Arab world.\n\n“The confrontation of such proliferation should be comprehensive,” he said in his speech in Jordan. “Yet this is not an easy task because it (terrorism) is like cancer that spreads in the social fabric.”\n\nMany Egyptians believe that the administration of US President Donald Trump unlike his predecessor Barack Obama could consolidate the war against extremists.\n\nDespite the Obama administration’s long obstruction to deliver Egypt 10 helicopter gunships, Egyptian forces have in the past three years been able to launch a large-scale security campaign in Sinai.\n\nThe armed forces were able to close more than 95 percent of tunnels linking Sinai to the nearby Gaza Strip. Heavy weaponry were also deployed in Rafah, Sheikh Zuweid and Al-Arish and fighter jets carried out air strikes on vehicles transporting extremists.\n\nThen the army entered Mount Halal where battles in the past years have left hundreds of soldiers and civilians dead.\n\nHow Extremists Operate\n\nResidents now fear that the battles, which were confined to Rafah and Sheikh Zuweid, would move to El-Arish that has a population of 100,000.\n\nIt is believed that there are currently between 200 and 300 armed extremists in El-Arish, less than the number in the past three years.\n\nThese gunmen have the ability to move incognito inside the city’s alleyways by using small and light Korean-made vehicles.\n\n“Three to four gunmen suddenly storm a house. They stay there for a couple of hours, make threats, do as they like and suddenly disappear,” a trader in the city said.\n\nAccording to a security source, ISIS terrorists in El-Arish are operating in a complicated matter and are seeking to receive funds and weapons from the group’s branches in Syria and Libya.\n\nThey are also recruiting young men, who wear modern outfits and draw no suspicion, to facilitate their movement in the city that is barricaded by the army and security forces.\n\nMilitant attacks have been on the rise in El-Arish. Among such operations are the kidnapping of citizens for their alleged collaboration with the Egyptian authorities.\n\nLocal media have also shed light on the plight of the city’s Christians. They said scores have escaped El-Arish after the extremists killed several Christians and burned their houses.\n\nThey have sporadically targeted Christians while more frequently attacking police and military personnel in the north Sinai.

Opposition media groups, including Aleppo Today, said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter.\n\nAleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years, but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain.\n\nMeanwhile, the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday, state media and activists said, days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer.\n\nThe Central Military Media said 3,000 residents of two pro-regime villages, Foua and Kafarya, left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people, including opposition fighters, left Madaya and Zabadani, near Damascus, heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province.\n\nThe opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer, which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160, mostly gunmen, had remained in Zabadani.\n\n“The process has resumed with 3,000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas,” the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP.\n\nSecurity was tightened up for Wednesday’s departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked.\n\nThe AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched.\n\nAfter repeated delays, the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points, a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas, killing more than 120, mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which the regime blamed on the rebels.\n\nThe transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations.

Credit George Etheredge for The New York Times\n\nPodcasts are personal. Unlike the wide public broadcast of radio, a podcast begins whenever you touch “play,” then courses through your headphones and directly into your ears. Listening to a great podcast can feel like falling into conversation with a new best friend or eavesdropping on an infatuating crush. A bad one is like sitting next to the wrong stranger on the subway. Here are 10 good ones that debuted in 2016.\n\nComedy\n\n‘2 DOPE QUEENS’ Each week, the comedians and besties Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams — plus guests like Hannibal Buress and Ilana Glazer of “Broad City” — tear through popular culture, bantering and arguing about Tinder etiquette, being black at a Billy Joel concert and the questionable attractiveness of Lenny Kravitz (Phoebe says he’s hot; Jessica, not). Episodes are recorded at live shows in Brooklyn, then published in podcast form by WNYC.\n\n‘WHO? WEEKLY’ A new class of barely recognizable “celebrities” has come to dominate tabloid coverage, and the hosts Bobby Finger and Lindsey Weber are here to guide you through their obscure self-promotional world. The podcast feels delightfully absurd and truly vital in the Trump era, when castoff reality stars are suddenly in the presidential sphere of power.\n\nPersonal Lives\n\n‘WHY OH WHY’ In this auditory exploration of modern love, Andrea Silenzi plays both host and subject, delving into strangers’ romantic entanglements and processing her own with the same warm, wry curiosity. The show mimics dating’s emotional roller coaster, careening from the excruciating awkwardness of a real first date to the quiet heartache of Ms. Silenzi’s latest breakup. “Why Oh Why” is technically a reboot: It was once a cult favorite radio show on WFMU before it was reborn in podcast form on Panoply this fall.\n\n‘BAD WITH MONEY’ The writer, comedian and YouTube star Gaby Dunn plays an extremely amateur financial adviser here, using her own money troubles to facilitate discussions about unspeakable topics like addiction, exploitation and debt. What Ms. Dunn lacks in financial literacy she makes up for in charm and candor, and she coaxes her guests into trampling the taboos around money until they get to something real.\n\nSociety\n\n‘CODE SWITCH’ NPR’s Code Switch blog, a source of required reading on race and culture since 2013, is now a must-listen podcast. The hosts, the NPR journalists Gene Demby and Shereen Marisol Meraji — and guests like the former “Hamilton” cast member Christopher Jackson — take on the messy questions of race in America, like the dual identity of black police officers.\n\n‘SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING’ Started just before the election, this interview-driven podcast explores the diversity of backgrounds and experiences that contribute to Muslim identity in America. In recent episodes, the host Ahmed Ali Akbar, a staff writer at BuzzFeed, talks with a Muslim college student with a Trump-supporting roommate; the Iranian-American comedian Zahra Noorbakhsh; and his own father.\n\n‘CRIMETOWN’ Many buzzy true-crime podcasts play like procedurals, focusing on the commission and investigation of a particular deed. This Gimlet podcast advances the genre; it’s less “Law & Order,” more “The Wire.” Each season, “Crimetown” explores one city’s criminal element; first up is an engrossing and disturbing portrait of organized crime in Providence, R.I.\n\n‘IN THE DARK’ A rash of long-form true-crime podcasts was introduced this year, inspired by the success of “Serial.” “In the Dark” is the rare offering that improves on the original. Madeleine Baran, a reporter for American Public Media, reinvestigates the 1989 abduction of Jacob Wetterling, an 11-year-old Minnesotan. In contrast to Serial’s flashy, obsessive and ultimately unresolved whodunit, Ms. Baran’s jumps off from the story of one crime to tell a much bigger tale — one implicating an entire sheriff’s office in decades of failed policing.\n\n‘HOMECOMING’ The first fiction podcast from Gimlet Media is a slow-burning, star-studded thriller featuring Oscar Isaac as a traumatized military veteran and Catherine Keener as the government therapist assigned his case. The plot is cleverly wound with sinister disclosures about this homecoming program, but the real surprise here is the palpable chemistry between Mr. Isaac and Ms. Keener.\n\n‘ALICE ISN’T DEAD’ From the creators of the absurdist fiction hit “Welcome to Night Vale” comes a psychedelic thriller about a woman who sets off on a cross-country road trip to find her missing wife — only to drive into a creepy otherworld that lies off the map. Apart from haunting music and sound effects, it’s narrated exclusively by the actress Jasika Nicole, who manages to ground the story in human drama while describing the supernatural that surrounds her.\n\nThe New York Times", "title": "The Best New Podcasts of 2016", "url": "http://english.aawsat.com/amanda/lifestyle-culture/best-new-podcasts-2016", "main": "http://english.aawsat.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

We welcome readers’ feedback, debate, and additional submissions in the comments section below this document.\n\n2004\n\nFebruary 2004: A technical assessment of the Flint River raises concerns about using the river for drinking water. Key points of the “Source Water Assessment Report for the City of Flint Water Supply – Flint River Emergency Intake” prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and Flint Water Utilities Department:\n\n“(T)he emergency intake for the Flint Water Treatment Plant has a very high degree of sensitivity to potential contaminants. When the effects of agricultural and urban runoff in the Flint River watershed are considered, the Flint intake is categorized as very highly sensitive.”\n\n“The source water area for the Flint emergency intake includes 96 potential contaminant sources.”\n\n“The potential contaminant sources, in combination with the very highly sensitive intake, indicate that the Flint emergency intake source water is very highly susceptible to potential contamination.\n\n“However, it is noted that when operating, the City of Flint Water Treatment Plant has effectively treated this source water to meet drinking water standards.”\n\n(TRUTH SQUAD ANALYSIS: For many years, the City of Flint bought water from the Detroit drinking water system. But the Flint Water Treatment plant retained access to the Flint River for emergency backup purposes. As this timeline fully outlines, Flint - with official approval from its state-appointed manager and State Treasurer Andy Dillon, but also with support of local officials – switched to the Flint River as its drinking water source in spring 2014. This was designed as a temporary move while awaiting the new Karegnondi Water Authority regional drinking water pipeline from Lake Huron to come online in late 2016.)\n\n2011\n\nJuly 2011: Report from Rowe Engineering titled “Analysis of the Flint River as a Permanent Water Supply for the City of Flint.” Prepared for the City of Flint. Key points:\n\n“Preliminary analysis indicates that water from the river can be treated to meet current regulations’ however, additional treatment will be required than for Lake Huron water. This results in higher operating costs that the alternative of anew Lake Huron supply…. (A)esthetics of the finished water will be different than from Lake Huron. As an example, the temperature of water supplied to customers during the summer will be warmer than the present Lake Huron supply, because of the increased summer temperature in the relatively shallow river.”\n\n“A detailed investigation of potential sources of contamination has not been completed.”\n\nNovember, 29, 2011: “Flint becomes the fourth city in the state brought under control of an emergency manager… after a review team shows accumulated deficits of $25.7 million.” (As reported by the Detroit Free Press, January 2016.)\n\n2012\n\nMay 9, 2012: Letter from Flint Department of Public Works Director Howard Croft to MDEQ District Engineer Mike Prysby: “The Karegnondi Water Authority has the potential to be a major factor in our region’s economic development efforts. The City of Flint is pleased to be a partner in the process and we pledge to offer our assets to support the development. We appreciate your technical support as we develop our components of the project.”\n\nJune 2012: Flint emergency manager Mike Brown asks the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) for permission to blend Flint River water with DWSD water to save Flint between $2 million and $3 million annually. (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.)\n\nNovember 2012: A successor Flint emergency manager Ed Kurtz writes to state Treasurer Andy Dillon suggesting that the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) is the best long-term option for Flint water due to rising costs from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), projected at $23 million per year by the year 2020. (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.) The KWA positions itself as an example of local government control for entities in Genesee, Lapeer, and Sanilac counties roughly an hour’s drive north of Detroit. As the KWA website currently states in February 2016, “By joining the group it will give you more control over the costs and the water. Currently, you purchase finished water from the (Detroit Water and Sewerage Department) with no input as to the cost. As a member of the group, you will purchase raw water and treat it to your own standards. As a member, you will participate in establishing the cost and rates for the water.”\n\n2013\n\nJanuary 23, 2013: Email from MDEQ’s Prysby to colleague Liane Shekter Smith and others about feasibility of Flint switching to the Flint River… “I agree that the city should have concerns of fully utilizing the Flint River (100%) for the following: the need to soften, the potential for more advanced treatment after next round of crypto monitoring, available capacity in Flint River at 100-year low flow, residuals management (disposal of lime sludge).”\n\nFebruary 2013: Engineering study ordered by state Treasury Department concludes KWA is the cheaper option for Flint water. (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.)\n\nMarch 2013: Flint City Council endorses joining the Karegnondi Water Authority. (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.) MLive coverage, headlined “Flint City Council approves resolution to buy water from Karegnondi, state approval still needed,” documents considerable local support for the switch:\n\n“We got there, that’s the important thing.” – Flint City Councilman Joshua Freeman.\n\n“Going with Karegnondi is the best decision.” – Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition\n\n“It’s a historic night for the city of Flint.” – Flint Mayor Dayne Walling.\n\nThe only dissenting vote was from Councilman Bryan Nolden. \"I just feel like the Flint River is our best option,” he said.\n\n(Truth Squad Note: The council's vote is symbolic; with the city under control of a state-appointed emergency manager, the council vote is not binding. Final decision to switch from DWSD to KWA was made by state treasurer Andy Dillon.\n\nMarch 26, 2013: Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright, who is not party to the water contract, nevertheless writes a letter of support for the decision: “I have said from the beginning that this decision must be made by Flint’s City Council and Mayor. I appreciate the council voting the way they did, but even more than that, I am glad the residents of Flint were able to have their voices heard via their elected officials... There is a basic tenet of government is best when it has local control. We saw that with the council vote. Nobody, whether they live in Flint, Grand Blanc, Davison, Fenton, or anywhere in Genesee County, should have these types of decisions made by people who live outside their community.”\n\nMarch 26, 2013: Email from Michael Alexander at MDEQ to colleagues Stephen Busch, Christine Alexander, and William Creal. Email titled “Flint River Intake Location.”\n\nBased on the listing form Michigan’s 2012 Integrated Report, the Flint River from just upstream of the City of Flint to the upstream end of the Holloway Reservoir is not meeting its designated uses for: Fish consumption due to PCB in fish tissue and water column Total and partial body contact due to E. coli in water column Other indigenous aquatic life due to nutrients and phosphorus in the water column.\n\n\n\nThese are just the major categories for the designated uses currently not being met within this subject stretch of the Flint River.”\n\nMarch 26, 2013: Email from Stephen Busch (MDEQ) to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant with Liane Shekter Smith and other MDEQ staff copied. Key points – warnings about Flint River water quality. The memo is written “in preparation for a call” same day with the office of State Treasurer Andy Dillon:\n\n“All contract options with DWSD that are considered semi-competitive with the KWA contract do not fully supply the City of Flint, and would require the City of Flint to meet a significant, if not majority, of its water demands by treating water from the Flint River. Continuous use of the Flint River at such demand rates would:\n\nPose an increased microbial risk to public health (Flint River vs. Lake Huron source water)\n\nPose an increased risk of disinfection by-product (carcinogen) exposure to public health (Flint River vs. Lake Huron source water)\n\nTrigger additional regulatory requirements under the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act.”\n\nMarch 27, 2013: Email from Jim Sygo (MDEQ) to colleague Steven Busch regarding possible Flint water switches:\n\n“As you might guess we are in a situation with Emergency Financial Managers so it’s entirely possible that they will be making decisions relative to cost. The concern in either situation is that a compliant supply of source water and drinking water can be supplied.”\n\nMarch 28, 2013: Email from State Treasurer Andy Dillon to Governor Rick Snyder, with copies to numerous other Treasury officials and MDEQ Director Dan Wyant:\n\n“Governor, based upon today’s presentations to the DEQ by the City of Flint, KWA and the engineering firm (Tucker Young) Treasury hired to vet the options as to whether Flint should stay with DWSD or join KWA, I am recommending we support the City of Flint’s decision to join KWA. The City’s Emergency Manager, Mayor, and City Council all support this decision. Dan Wyant likewise concurs and will confirm via email.”\n\n“We have a briefing call tomorrow morning with Dennis and John to provide more background as to why we reached this conclusion. Flint’s Emergency Manager wants to sign the resolution asap as the project is moving forward with or without them and their participation affects the design and the construction season is upon them. I assume DWSD will make a last ditch effort to save the customer but I will not advise them of my recommendation until we brief Dennis and John.”\n\nApril 1, 2013: The DWSD “responds to Flint’s decision, issuing a statement that Flint’s plans will not save money. The statement also says Flint has ‘launched the greatest water war in Michigan history’ and that it will result in higher prices for the department’s other customers.” (As reported by the Detroit Free Press, January 2016.)\n\nApril 2013: State Treasurer Andy Dillon gives state emergency manager Ed Kurtz permission to notify the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department that it would be terminating service in the future and contracting with the KWA. (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.)\n\nApril 15, 2013: “The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department provides a best and final offer to the City of Flint. Analyses by Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz, the Department of Environmental Quality and Treasury’s Office of Fiscal Responsibility independently conclude that the Karegnondi Water Authority option is cheaper for the City of Flint.” (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.)\n\nApril 16, 2013: “Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz informs the State Treasurer that the city will join KWA. This decision was officially announced May 1, 2013.” (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015 and in a December 2015 Michigan Auditor General investigation report.)\n\nApril 17, 2013: DWSD transmits letter to Flint emergency manager Kurtz terminating service to the City of Flint, effective exactly one year later, April 17, 2014. (As reported in the Michigan Department of Treasury Flint Water Timeline, September 2015.)\n\nJune 2013: KWA breaks ground, completion expected in late 2016. (From October 2014 MDEQ briefing to the Snyder Administration.)\n\nJune 21 2013: Emergency Manager Kurtz signs contract with engineering company to prepare the Flint water treatment plant to begin using the Flint River as primary source of water. Here’s the contract.\n\nJune 29, 2013: All-day meeting of Flint, Genesee County Drain Commissioner and MDEQ officials where they discuss feasibility of using Flint River until KWA is ready. (As reported by the Detroit Free Press, January 2016)\n\n\n\nAugust 2013: Rowe Professional Services completes an engineering proposal for improvements that would allow Flint to draw water continuously from the Flint River in lieu of DWSD service. (From October 2014 MDEQ briefing to the Snyder Administration.)\n\n2014\n\nMarch 7, 2014: Another Flint Emergency Manager, Darnell Earley, sends letter to DWSD saying Flint will switch to the Flint River as primary source of water, and disconnect from DWSD. Here's the letter.\n\nMarch 26, 2014: Email from Steven Busch to Liane Shekter Smith and Richard Benzie, MDEQ chief of field operations for the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance: “One of the things we didn’t get to today that I would like to make sure everyone is on the same page on is what Flint will be required to do in order to start using their plant full time. Because the plant is setup for emergency use, they could startup at any time, but starting up for continuous operation will carry significant changes in regulatory requirements so there is a very gray area as to what we consider for startup.”\n\nApril 16, 2014: Warning from Michael Glasgow, a water treatment plant operator for the City of Flint, to Adam Rosenthal at MDEQ:\n\n“I am expecting changes to our Water Quality Monitoring parameters, and possibly our DBP on lead & copper monitoring plan… Any information would be appreciated, because it looks as if we will be starting the plant up tomorrow and are being pushed to start distributing water as soon as possible… I would like to make sure we are monitoring, reporting and meeting requirements before I give the OK to start distributing water.”\n\nApril 17, 2014: Warning from Flint Water Treatment Plant’s Michael Glasgow to Adam Rosenthal, Mike Prysby, and Stephen Busch at MDEQ:\n\n“I assumed there would be dramatic changes to our monitoring. I have people above me making plans to distribute water ASAP. I was reluctant before, but after looking at the monitoring schedule and our current staffing, I do not anticipate giving the OK to begin sending water our anytime soon. If water is distributed from this plant in the next couple of weeks, it will be against my direction. I need time to adequately train additional staff and to update our monitoring plans before I will feel we are ready. I will reiterate this to management above me, but they seem to have their own agenda.”\n\nApril 23, 2014: Email from Steve Busch to MDEQ colleague Brad Wurfel discussing talking points for a public meeting in Flint regarding drinking water. Busch raises this talking point… “While the Department is satisfied with the City’s ability to treat water from the Flint River, the Department looks forward to the long term solution of continued operation of the City of Flint Water Treatment Plant using water from the KWA as a more consistent and higher quality source water.”\n\nApril 24: 2014: Email from Daugherty Johnson, City of Flint Utilities Administrator, to Flint colleague Howard Croft, and Mike Prysby and Stephen Busch at MDEQ:\n\n“As you are aware, the City has undergone extensive upgrades to our Water Treatment Plant and its associated facilities. Our intentions and efforts have been to operate our facility as the primary drinking water source for the City of Flint. Through consultation with your office and our engineering firm we’ve developed a system of redundant electrical systems, treatment processes and adequate finished water storage to negate the need for a signed backup agreement with DWSD due to their termination of our contract. Upon inspection of these facilities would you convey your concurrence that there is no regulatory requirement for us to sign up a back up agreement with DWSD.”\n\nApril 25, 2014: Flint officially begins using Flint River as temporary primary water source. City press release touts that “officials from the City of Flint, the Genesee County Drain Commission, and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality were all on hand to witness the historic event.” The press release notes that the city used the Flint River as a temporary source of drinking water at numerous points in the past and said, “Each temporary stint on local water proved three things to city employees and residents alike: That a transition to local river water could be done seamlessly, and that it was both sensible and safe for us to use our own water as a primary water source in Flint.” Flint DPW Director Howard Croft states in the press release, “The test results have shown that our water is not only safe, but of the high quality that Flint customers have come to expect. We are proud of that end result.” Flint Mayor Dayne Walling states. “It’s regular, good, pure drinking water, and it’s right in our backyard. This is the first step in the right direction for Flint, as we take this monumental step forward in controlling the future of our community’s most precious resource.”\n\nMay 15, 2014: Email from Jennifer Crooks (EPA) to colleagues Mindy Eisenberg, Thomas Poy and Tinka Hyde:\n\n“A Mr. Lathan Jefferson has talked with Tinka, and also with me just now about his drinking water quality. Flint has just switched from Detroit water (from Lake Huron) to Flint River water within the past couple of weeks. Flint River quality is not great, but there is a surface water treatment plan producing water that is currently meeting SDWA standards, according to the MI DEQ district engineer, Mike Prysby. The water has more hardness, and pH and alkalinity may be different from Detroit water…. Mr. Jefferson said he and many people have rashes from the new water. He said his doctor says the rash is from the new drinking water, and I told him to have his doctor document this and he can bring to the attention of the MI DEQ, since lab analyses to date show that the drinking water is meeting all health-based standards. He has no interest in speaking with Mike Prysby; he doesn’t trust anyone in MI government. He asked me for free drinking water lab analyses, which I was unable to provide. He only wants to speak with someone from EPA headquarters.”\n\n(TRUTH SQUAD NOTE: Eisenberg was a high-ranking official at EPA in Washington, D.C.)\n\nJune 2014: Complaints are now coming in regarding Flint drinking water quality. Flint Mayor Dayne Walling and state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley continuee to tell residents the water is safe. “It’s a quality, safe product,” Walling tells MLive.com. “I think people are wasting their precious money buying bottled water.”\n\nJuly 2014: Michigan Department of Environmental Quality begins first six-month testing and monitoring of Flint water under the department’s interpretation of the federal Lead and Copper rule.\n\n(TRUTH SQUAD ANALYSIS: A wide range of documents, including a January 2016 order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, will eventually determine the City of Flint and MDEQ did not anticipate or provide for corrosion control. As a result, the highly corrosive Flint River water in city water lines would cause hazardous lead to leach into city drinking water supplies and into the homes of Flint residents.)\n\nAugust 15, 2014: Flint issues boil water advisory after fecal coliform bacteria is discovered in the water. The city adds chlorine to treatment.\n\nSeptember 5, 2014: Second boil-water advisory issued by Flint because of coliform bacteria.\n\nOctober 13, 2014: “General Motors said it will no longer use the river water at its engine plant because of fears it will cause corrosion” due to high chloride levels. GM instead buys Lake Huron water from Flint Township. (As reported by MLive.com.)\n\nOctober 13, 2014: Email from Mike Prysby to Busch, Shekter Smith and others at MDEQ… Inquiry from Ron Fonger at Flint Journal concerning GM getting off Flint water. Prysby notes that Flint water is elevated for chlorides but downplays the issue… “although not optimal” he said, it’s “satisfactory…” “I stressed the importance of not branding Flint’s water as ‘corrosive’ from a public health standpoint simply because it does not meet a manufacturing facility’s limit for production.”\n\nOctober 14, 2014: In the final weeks of Governor Rick Snyder’s re-election campaign, two key Snyder aides raise alarm bells about Flint water. Snyder deputy legal counsel Valerie Brader stressed the need for urgent action on Flint’s water supply in 2014. Brader emails Snyder Chief of Staff Dennis Muchmore, Communications Director Jarrod Agen, Legal Counsel Michael Gadola, and Deputy Chief of Staff Beth Clement. She urges them to ask the Flint emergency manager to consider moving Flint off the Flint River and back to the Detroit drinking water system “as an interim solution to both the quality, and now the financial, problems that the current solution is causing.” At the time, Flint residents had been complaining about the water for months. A day earlier, General Motors announced it would stop using Flint River water because it interfered with the manufacturing process. Flint had issued boil water advisories. And there were growing concerns about the amount of chemicals Flint needed to use to treat the river water.\n\n“I see this as an urgent matter to fix,” Brader wrote.\n\nThe governor’s chief legal counsel, Michael Gadola, responds 12 minutes later to everyone on Valerie Brader’s original email string.\n\n“… (T)o anyone who grew up in Flint as I did, the notion that I would be getting my drinking water from the Flint River is downright scary. Too bad the (emergency manager) didn’t ask me what I thought, though I’m sure he heard it from plenty of others. My Mom is a City resident. Nice to know she’s drinking water with elevated chlorine levels and fecal coliform. I agree with Valerie.

In 2014, Liane Shekter Smith, the head of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance for the state Department of Environmental Quality, had contacted state health officials “a couple of times” to discuss the outbreak, the emails show. “She was concerned that an announcement was going to be made soon about the water as the source of the infection; I told her the Flint water was at this point just a hypothesis,” Bohm wrote in an email.\n\nOctober 21, 2014: Susan Bohm of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services alerts officials in Genesee County in an e-mail that there are concerns that Flint’s water would be linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, a pneumonia that can be caused by inhaling water vapors, according to emails obtained by the Detroit Free Press .

(photo courtesy of MLive) Traverse City has become a booming, chic vacation destination, but sees a looming need for young professionals and other workers to maintain growth. (photo courtesy of MLive)\n\nTRAVERSE CITY — During the summer, Traverse City can feel like a crowded metropolis, with traffic jams and lines for restaurant seats and parking spaces downtown, just the sort of place said to attract younger workers critical to future growth.\n\nThe crowds, though, are largely tourists. The city itself has just 15,000 permanent residents. Grand Traverse County, as a whole, has not quite 90,000, roughly the same number who live in Canton Township, west of Detroit.\n\nAnd although the local economy is thriving in many ways, the county is facing a looming attrition of baby boomers and stands a very real chance of losing the talent wars if it can’t figure out how to attract new, younger workers to live there full time.\n\nLow-paying jobs and a lack of affordable housing are two of the culprits.\n\nToo few rental units in the city center have created a serious housing crunch — especially among millennials, the generation loosely defined as born between the early 1980s and early 2000s — that is driving up rent prices, lengthening wait lists and contributing to a labor shortage that has employers worried.\n\n“Housing is one of the big things underlying the skills gap or the talent shortage, particularly when you’re talking about younger workers,” said Sarah Lucas, regional planning department manager for Networks Northwest, a Traverse City-based firm that assists with workforce and business development across 10 counties.\n\n“We hear often — almost daily — about businesses who can’t fill jobs because they can’t find people who have the skills to work them,” Lucas said.\n\n“At the same time, we hear from young people who want to live up here, are able to find jobs up here, but … can’t take the job because they can’t find a place to live. Or, it’s too expensive, or they have to drive too far from the place they can afford.”\n\nWhat young professionals need is workforce housing, said Allison Beers, owner of Traverse City-based meeting and event planning firm Events North and chairwoman of the Traverse City Young Professionals networking group.\n\n“With a lot of the jobs paying $25,000 to $35,000, you can’t afford a $1,400-a-month apartment — or, if you are, you’re living with four people,” Beers said. “We have a lot of great, beautiful places in town, but they are high-end condos. And so for young people, they want to live where they can work and walk and bike and come downtown and have dinner and go run an errand.”\n\nBeers said she hasn’t heard of people who passed up jobs because they can’t find housing. But she does know of people who move 15 minutes from downtown because that’s the closest they can afford to live, and of people who post to Facebook in search of roommates when leases expire.\n\n“We need to get ahead of it before it is an issue,” she said.\n\nUphill climb\n\nAddressing the talent shortage will be critical as Traverse City and surrounding communities in the northwestern Lower Peninsula deal with recession-era growing pains.\n\nTraverse City has fewer workers than it did close to a decade ago, before the recession sent many of them packing in search of jobs, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). Many positions that remain aren’t paying enough to keep pace with inflation. Even some better-paying positions may go begging. Business leaders are concerned about an aging group of engineers and machine operators nearing retirement without a full pipeline of younger workers to replace them.\n\nTraverse City, like many small and rural towns across the country, is facing an uphill climb because of young professionals’ preference to live in dense, metropolitan cities, said Lou Glazer, president of Ann Arbor-based think tank Michigan Future Inc., which studies talent retention amid the transition to an information economy.\n\nLarge technology and professional companies, with the exception of health care and education, typically don’t set up in small towns because they don’t have a large enough talent pool, Glazer said.\n\n“Knowledge-based employers, even though they have to pay higher wages — and obviously, they’d rather not pay higher wages — are concentrating in bigger metros because that’s the only place they can find a concentration of workers,” he said.\n\n“Raising wages or lowering housing costs are two ways to change the value proposition. But I don’t know that that’s enough.”\n\nThe region’s chamber of commerce is trying to address the attrition problem through new efforts to promote living and working in northern Michigan. But solving the affordable housing problem remains the top policy priority.\n\nAttracting people to tourism and hospitality-related jobs can be harder, Glazer said, since those workers often have higher transportation costs because they live farther from work and don’t have access to public transit.\n\nA minimum-wage worker would need to work close to two full-time jobs to afford a two-bedroom apartment at market rates in Grand Traverse County, estimated at $825 per month, according to data from the Washington, D.C.-based National Low Income Housing Coalition. To afford that rent on a standard 40-hour week, a person would need to earn at least $15.87 per hour, or about $33,000 a year.\n\nYet that income would be out of reach for most of the region’s service workers, according to ACS data; median annual earnings for a retail worker were $18,287 in 2013, the most recent year available. Lodging and food service workers earned $13,682, and employees in entertainment or recreation jobs made $20,442.\n\nAn affordable rental in Traverse City is generally considered to cost about $650 per month, Lucas said. Data in the Networks Northwest report suggest people in Grand Traverse County making 30 percent of the 2015 area median income of $69,200 could afford to pay $519 in monthly rent.\n\nGrand Traverse County residents who earn $11.25 per hour, estimated to be the mean hourly wage for workers who rent, could afford to pay $585 per month.\n\n“Most people right now are trying to figure out how to handle the affordable housing issue,” said Laura Galbraith, executive director of Traverse City-based Venture North Funding & Development, the region’s economic development agency. “The talent attraction piece is still kind of segmented by industry.\n\n“We will have to be more innovative.”\n\nThe housing problem\n\nBoth Traverse City and greater Grand Traverse County are made up mostly of owner-occupied homes.\n\nTraverse City has more than 2,500 rental units within city limits, or about 39 percent of the city’s total occupied housing stock, according to 2013 data from the American Community Survey. The data doesn’t break down to show how many of those are downtown, or how many might be seasonal.\n\nMore than half of renters in the city — 58 percent — pay $750 per month or more to lease an apartment or house. The median monthly rent is $808.\n\nIn Grand Traverse County, which has about 8,500 rental units, rentals make up just a quarter of all occupied housing. Renters countywide also pay more than in the city — nearly 65 percent pay at least $750 per month, and median monthly rent is $847, ACS data show.\n\nAffordable housing advocates say the shortage of rentals is not isolated to Traverse City. Housing costs have a disproportionate impact on people who work in Traverse City but live farther out — particularly those with lower incomes — because of the added transportation and energy costs.\n\nMany people in rural areas choose to live there because rent can be cheaper, but they often have no reliable public transit and rely on propane heat. Networks Northwest said propane can cost three times as much as natural gas in some rural counties, including Kalkaska and Antrim.\n\nIn its study, the agency found the problem has been exacerbated by both demographic shifts and policy choices.\n\nMost new home construction in the region has emphasized single-family homes on large rural lots, its authors wrote. But the demand for rentals is rising faster than units are being built — from seniors trying to downsize, families with lingering economic constraints keeping them from buying a home and young professionals who are delaying marriage and kids.\n\n“At its simplest, the phrase ‘affordable housing’ simply refers to housing that costs 30 percent or less of a household’s income,” wrote the authors of Networks Northwest’s study.\n\nThat figure can increase to 45 percent for housing and transit combined, Lucas said. In some places in the northwestern Lower Peninsula, she added, some people pay 60 percent or more of their income on those two expenses.\n\n“We try to focus on the need to locate new housing development near employment, near schools, near shopping, so people have the option to walk or bike to work,” Lucas said, adding that it’s a long-term solution.\n\n“We’re seeing what happens when you don’t do that.”\n\nGrowing healthcare sector\n\nThe rental crunch is making it more challenging for employers to land new hires.\n\nAn exception to the rule might be health care. It was the fastest-growing employment sector in Traverse City over much of the past decade, according to ACS data.\n\nGalbraith, with Traverse City’s economic development agency, said health care has consistently been a growing industry that may have had an easier time recruiting doctors or nurses with attractive pay — unlike, say, construction or manufacturing, which are just beginning to pick up after the recession.\n\nOverall, though, the region is struggling to attract and keep a talented workforce.\n\nThe Traverse City area’s jobless rate, while lower than the state’s, has been dropping steadily for several years. But so has the size of its labor force — from a peak of 78,812 in 2006 to 74,833 in 2014, the most recent year available in state records.\n\nThat would indicate potential employees are leaving the area or dropping out of the workforce altogether, which happens when the unemployed stop looking for work. The labor force has ticked upward slightly since 2012, but it remains below the pre-recession peak.\n\nThe region’s economy is still heavily tourism-based, much of it during the summer. In fact, a third of the city’s total employment pool in 2013 consisted of workers in three industries — retail; lodging and food services; and arts, recreation and entertainment, according to the ACS.\n\nAt least seven of the 10 most-wanted job postings by occupation in the region for July were in retail or other service fields, encompassing retail clerks and supervisors, housekeepers, cooks, food service supervisors, customer service representatives and waiters, according to data from the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget.\n\nIn total, 69 percent of the postings required less than a college degree. Truck drivers and registered nurses were the two most in-demand positions.\n\nRestaurants and other service employers are having a hard time finding housing for their workers, particularly those who need short-term seasonal housing, but the issue also is affecting professional and management employees, Lucas said.\n\nGlazer, of Michigan Future, said places like Traverse City are challenged to maximize their tourism economies while building other sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, education and some small-scale manufacturing.\n\nIt will be tough for the city — and smaller towns like it — to attract major companies to set up corporate headquarters or offices in fields like finance, telecommunications and software development because of their limited talent pool, he said.\n\n“None of that’s going to small towns,” Glazer said. “To some degree, they’re stuck.”\n\nYet, he added: “For northern Michigan, they’re in better shape than anywhere else because they are more attractive.”\n\nMovement on pay\n\nA wage survey hasn’t been done in several years, Galbraith said, but anecdotally she has heard that some employers are beginning to pay more in an effort to compete for talent.\n\nShe said some employers are offering pay above Michigan’s $8.15 base wage, to the tune of $9 to $12 per hour.\n\nStill, that’s not the $15.87 hourly rate Networks Northwest identified as necessary just to afford a market-rate apartment.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nLucas, of Networks Northwest, said local governments can help by amending zoning rules to incentivize smaller homes or affordable units, such as offering payments in lieu of taxes to private developers.\n\nTraverse City has an ordinance on the books that allows developers to build one additional market-rate unit for each affordable unit they include in a multifamily building, she said, but it’s voluntary and hasn’t yet been used.\n\nOther possible policy changes: Launching partnerships between developers and nonprofit housing agencies to integrate more units into planned projects; creating a public housing trust fund with a dedicated revenue source that can subsidize affordable housing development; and encouraging construction of new upscale rentals, rather than condos, to free up cheaper apartments for lower-income tenants.\n\n“I think we all know what the problems are. We’re just trying to get our hands around how to fix it,” said Rob Bacigalupi, executive director of the city’s Downtown Development Authority. “One agency can’t solve them all, but hopefully together we can.”\n\n", "title": "Traverse City’s dilemma: Why this hot vacation mecca can’t attract young workers", "url": "http://www.bridgemi.com/business-bridge/traverse-citys-dilemma-why-hot-vacation-mecca-cant-attract-young-workers", "main": "http://www.bridgemi.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-16 18:12:46-04:00", "authors": [], "content": "LANSING — The state’s economic development agency is trying to figure out how it legally can allow an Ohio-based steelmaker to claim business tax credits it believes it inherited when it bought the former Rouge steel plant in Dearborn nearly three years ago.\n\nThe Michigan Economic Development Corp. won’t confirm how far along it is in the process with AK Steel Corp., saying only that it’s still researching legal options. But AK Steel says the state is on board, rankling environmental groups and lawmakers from both parties over what they perceive as closed-door bargaining.\n\nThe transparency questions are swirling as the MEDC and AK Steel discuss job retention and brownfield credits that now total $50 million to $60 million, by one estimate. AK Steel, which bought the Dearborn operations of Russian steelmaker OAO Severstal in 2014 for $707 million, contends the tax credits originally awarded to Severstal are among the assets it now controls.\n\nHere’s the rub: Michigan’s tax code prohibits AK Steel from claiming the credits because the company pays its business taxes under the state’s new 6 percent corporate income tax, not the old Michigan Business Tax that carved out the credits. The MEDC says there’s no precedent for what happens to tax credits when the two companies involved file under different tax codes.\n\n“We are pleased that the state has agreed to deliver on its promise under the contract,” AK Steel spokeswoman Lisa Jester said via email. “This tax credit, as permitted under our contract, is important to help us manage our business and continue to support jobs and the economy of southeastern Michigan.”\n\nJester declined additional comment. The MEDC would not confirm Jester’s account.\n\nIn dispute are a 20-year credit under the old Michigan Economic Growth Authority program, which was awarded to Severstal in 2005 and worth an estimated $55 million to $60 million, and a 10-year brownfield credit against the Michigan Business Tax approved in 2011 and worth an estimated $40 million, according to AK Steel and the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency in an analysis of legislation that failed to advance in last year’s session.\n\nSeverstal’s MEGA credit was set to expire in 2026 at an original estimated value of $48.6 million, according to the MEDC.\n\nWhile West Chester, Ohio-based AK Steel is believed to be the first company seeking to do this, it’s possible that a favorable outcome for AK Steel could set a tax precedent for other companies that wind up in a similar scenario through a merger or acquisition.\n\nAK Steel’s request has unleashed criticism over the steelmaker’s environmental violations in Michigan, a lack of transparency surrounding talks and the belief among some that a deal to transfer credits would amount to an expansion of an expensive and unpopular — not to mention, defunct — tax credit program that will cost the state billions of dollars in payouts by the time it ends.\n\n“Someone has set this up as a curtain where I can’t look behind,” state Rep. Peter Lucido, R-Shelby Township, told Crain’s. “If I’m giving away something, I want all my colleagues — both in the House and the Senate — to make that decision.”\n\nLucido and a handful of House colleagues — including Republican Martin Howrylak of Troy and Democrats Stephanie Chang, of Detroit, and Abdullah Hammoud, of Dearborn — issued a news release in March citing concerns with the MEDC’s process.\n\nMichigan’s liability under MEGA topped $9 billion, largely because the program was expanded to include incentives for retaining jobs during the recession. The state’s payouts created budget holes in recent years because of volatility stemming from when companies chose to redeem the credits, and have made some legislators gun-shy to approve new incentives.\n\nLegislators in the House and Senate last year attempted to change the state’s tax laws to allow a company to claim a credit that had been awarded to a company it acquired, but the efforts failed.\n\nShort of a legislative fix, “we’re evaluating the situation,” MEDC spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said. “We would prefer the Legislature weighing in and creating a clear interpretation.”\n\nDifferent tax structures\n\nAK Steel (NYSE: AKS) bought the plant it calls Dearborn Works in 2014 from Severstal as the Russian company sold off its U.S. facilities. The purchase was part of a plan to locate its carbon steelmaking business near its large automotive customers.\n\nThe plant traces its roots to the 1920s, when it was part of Ford Motor Co.’s iconic Rouge plant. Severstal bought it out of bankruptcy from Rouge Steel Co. in 2004 for $285 million.\n\nRoughly 1,500 employees work there today, AK Steel said.\n\nThe company since has spent more than $30 million at the Dearborn plant to expand a steel production line, Jester said via email.\n\nAK Steel reported a net loss of $7.8 million in 2016 on sales of $5.9 billion, according to recent SEC filings. Allan Thompson, AK Steel’s corporate tax manager, told lawmakers in November that the company is committed to its Dearborn operations despite pressure from foreign producers, which has led to years of operating losses.\n\nA company the size of AK Steel presumably would have had tax advisers who were aware of the conflict between the corporate income tax and the Michigan Business Tax, said Gina Staudacher, a partner in the corporate tax group of Howard & Howard Attorneys PLLC in Royal Oak.\n\nStandard MEGA agreements did include clauses that credits can transfer as part of a merger or acquisition, she said.\n\n“It happens rather routinely in the M&A world that (tax credits) are transitional items that can be carried forward to the resulting company,” she said and it likely influenced the price.\n\nA potential solution that might satisfy both the state and the company could be to budget what’s left of Severstal’s credits as part of the current business development program within the MEDC, and include requirements for environmental upgrades or pollution controls, Staudacher said.\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nAK Steel’s environmental record is one reason cited by some who oppose transferring the credit.\n\nThe plant is located near an industrial cluster that has contributed to pollution and public health concerns, such as asthma, in portions of Dearborn and southwest Detroit.\n\nThompson said AK Steel increased its environmental compliance staff at the Dearborn facility from two under Severstal to five after the purchase closed, and spent $29 million in 2015 on pollution control equipment. He also said Severstal had 23,896 reported air permit deviations in 2013, a number that fell to 33 in 2016 under AK Steel’s ownership.\n\nAK Steel has received four violation notices since Jan. 1, 2016, according to Michigan Department of Environmental Quality spokeswoman Melody Kindraka, including one issued Feb. 23 this year for fallout from a large brown plume that spilled over from the Dearborn property in December 2016.\n\nHammoud, a first-term Democrat from Dearborn, has asked that AK Steel and MEDC include plans for capital improvements during the next five to 10 years that could lead to fewer emissions and environmental violations in an agreement, but said he has heard that so far the provision has not been included.\n\nNeither the MEDC nor AK Steel have disclosed details of the ongoing legal review", "title": "AK Steel tax credits are $60M question for state, drawing backlash", "url": "http://www.bridgemi.com/business-bridge/ak-steel-tax-credits-are-60m-question-state-drawing-backlash", "main": "http://www.bridgemi.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

She’s an ardent environmentalist who, like many of her neighbors in Northern Michigan, rails against the aging Enbridge Line 5 pipeline that carries oil under the straits of Mackinac.\n\nShe laughs loud and often, admittedly not always at appropriate topics. That ability to laugh through good times and bad has come in handy over the years. She was an alcoholic, who kicked the addiction 11 years ago. She lost a six-figure job as a commercial insurance broker in Chicago when the economy tanked around 2010. She moved to Harbor Springs, where she has at times struggled to pay the mortgage with money earned managing the homes and affairs of busy friends.\n\nAnother financial hurdle looming in the future is her daughter’s potentially expensive wedding in September.\n\nFor a three-month stretch two years ago, Shafer opted not to be insured. “I just couldn’t afford it,” Shafer said. “It was insurance or the mortgage. I didn’t know if I’d be able to afford it again in a few months.”\n\nAs it turned out, she was able to sign up after just a few months, and was covered when her breast cancer was diagnosed.\n\n“God was watching out for me because I got (insurance again) and then got (the cancer diagnosis). It was never my intent not to get it. But am I going to pay my mortgage or pay healthcare?”\n\nShafer is among the roughly 5 percent of Americans who buy health insurance on the open market, rather than getting insurance through their workplace, a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare, or through an ACA exchange. In most years, Shafer earns too much money to qualify for health insurance subsidies offered through the ACA.\n\nShe’s paid as much as $900 a month for health insurance, though now her premium is around $550 a month for insurance she buys privately rather than through the ACA exchange. Shafer said it angers her that she pays so much for health insurance and still pay a $10,000 deductible before her insurance kicks in.\n\nShafer met with Bridge on a March day when the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was planning to vote on repealing (and eventually replacing) the Affordable Care Act. Shafer wasn’t watching the news on the vote (which was postponed, then cancelled). She seldom watches or reads news, calling it a “black hole” and a “valley of despair.”\n\nStill, she felt a personal connection to the debate. Her own health care costs (and lack of affordable healthcare options) is one reason Shafer said she voted for Trump last November. She doesn’t believe the Affordable Care Act has benefited her, though she also admitted she wasn’t sure how the ACA impacts the rates or coverage of her health insurance, a Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan she buys on the private market.\n\n“How would I know if I’m on it (Obamacare)?” she asked.\n\nBut here’s the wrinkle with Shafer’s opinion on healthcare and healthcare politics. Here’s where she defies dogmatic stereotypes. The Trump voter said she believes in universal health care. She said she even respects Hillary Clinton for fighting for universal health care back in 1993 during her husband Bill Clinton’s first term in the White House.\n\nLiberals “have their hearts in the right place,” Shafer said.\n\nShafer said she realizes that a repeal of Obamacare takes the nation farther from universal health care, but that she thinks the current law has too many problems to fix. “I have friends who rehab old homes,” she said. “They say it’s easier to rip them apart and start over.\n\n“We waste so much money,” Shafer said. “They’ve got this (health care) so f----- up that I’d fire everyone and start over.”", "title": "Cancer diagnosis brings clarity to one Trump voter", "url": "http://www.bridgemi.com/quality-life/cancer-diagnosis-brings-clarity-one-trump-voter", "main": "http://www.bridgemi.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

For one, graceful summer homes rise on waterfronts, equipped with boats, tubes and toys. For the other, life is lived in trailers on back roads, or small houses tucked into the woods. One comes north in May and enjoys a summer of festivals, fun and restaurant dining. The other Michigan lives here year-round and waits tables or changes hotel beds. One is, like the state at large, recovering from the recession and building wealth. The other slips deeper into, or closer to, poverty.\n\nThree counties ‒ Charlevoix, Emmet and Cheboygan ‒ sit at the tip of Michigan’s mitten, looking out on glistening waters, looking in on a restless, largely invisible population still grappling with unsteady wages and the haunting sense that opportunity ‒ at least, for them ‒ has passed.

But the gap between the top and the bottom, in Charlevoix, Emmet and Cheboygan County is among the widest in Michigan.\n\nIncome disparity Charlevoix Cheboygan Emmet Statewide Median income (Top 5%) 317,930 241,494 374,282 270,710 Median income (Bottom 20%) 12,377 10,927 13,656 10,979 Difference 305,553 230,567 360,626 259,731 Disparity among MI counties (1=highest) 6th 18th 2nd Source :U.S. Census American Community Survey, 2009-2013\n\nApril Keller remembers when she was hired at American Spoon Foods 15 years ago. She was 25, had recently become a single mother, and was working as a cook at a bar/restaurant in the area. She was earning $6.75 an hour and worked nights and weekends, standard for restaurant work. When she was hired at American Spoon, a Petoskey-based purveyor of expensive jams and preserves, earning $9 an hour for regular daytime hours, no weekends, and year-round, she figured she’d lucked out.\n\n“Prior to that I had entry-level jobs, worked for minimum wage, the kind of jobs you do when you don’t have a degree,” said Keller, who eventually worked her way up to co-managing production at American Spoon. That’s the way it is for people like her, she added; many in her extended family would be considered working poor, and simply expect seasonal jobs and regular layoffs.\n\n“You have to do more than one (job) to get by,” she said.\n\nA faster slide\n\nIn Charlevoix-Emmet-Cheboygan, more people are tumbling into poverty even years after the depth of the economic downturn. The conditions aren’t extreme when considered against the rest of Michigan ‒ in comparison, Emmet’s poverty rate is low and Charlevoix’s is average, though Cheboygan’s is far higher.\n\nBut poverty in Emmet and Charlevoix has grown faster than the average among all Michigan counties since 2009. The ratio of Emmet and Charlevoix families with children living in poverty increased by one-third in that four-year period. In Cheboygan, poverty had risen 10 percent by 2013 with 26 percent of families with children in poverty.\n\nSeasonal Swings in Unemployment (2001-2014)\n\nHover over the graph to show data\n\n\n\nAnd, as Keller well knows, seasonal work sometimes means no work at all ‒ the average March unemployment rate spikes to more than 18 percent in Cheboygan County, and to nearly 12 percent and 13 percent in Charlevoix and Emmet counties, respectively - stark reminder of why it’s called the “slow season.”\n\nThe three counties lost 3,603 jobs in manufacturing, construction and natural resources between 2000 and 2013, according to an analysis of federal Bureau of Labor Statistics supplied by Scott Gest, regional planner for Networks Northwest, a 10-county planning body. In the same period, 2,272 jobs were added in services, including 573 in leisure and hospitality, which are far more likely to be seasonal, he said, and by definition, part-time.\n\nManufacturing plants like Continental Structural Plastics in Petoskey and Dura Automotive in Antrim County closed in 2007 and 2008, respectively, taking with them 400 jobs. With few alternatives, idled workers either left the region for better prospects or fell into long-term unemployment or underemployment.\n\nMore ominous, the region could be facing a less robust economic future as young professionals look for work elsewhere. The Charlevoix-Emmet-Cheboygan region lost a staggering 22 percent of people in the coveted 25-44 age group between 2000 and 2013.\n\nJustin Rashid, who founded American Spoon, the company that saved April Keller from the minimum-wage merry-go-round, said he understands why some people leave.\n\n“When people lose a job in northern Michigan, they fall out of a treehouse – often they have to move,” he said. “It’s not, ‘I lost my job, I’m going to work at a different place across town,’ it’s ‘I lost my job, I’m going to Grand Rapids. Or Chicago.’”\n\nYet the solution is not always as simple as “just add jobs.”\n\nEven as some workers leave, manufacturers like surgical instrument maker Precision Edge Inc. in Boyne City and DCL in Charlevoix, which makes dust control and loading systems, say they have good, well-paying jobs they can’t fill for lack of qualified skilled-trades employees.\n\nTransportation can be another barrier to employment. For workers, particularly at the lower edge of middle-class wages, who live miles from their jobs, the cost of commuting can eat a large chunk of their budget. It is an especially critical obstacle in Emmet County, which lacks a robust transit system.\n\nAnd looking into the future, children attending schools in the counties’ rural districts face twin obstacles ‒ poverty at home and tight budgets in the classroom ‒ as they study to meet the challenges of a competitive job market.\n\nA view of the bay\n\nIn some sense, much of this is nothing new in a region of nearly 85,000 people spread out over more than 3,000 square miles. Resort areas have always had seasonal economies. Rural areas have always had fewer job opportunities. That’s the price residents pay for glorious summers by blue bays and the chance to be paddling a kayak down a river 15 minutes after punching out of work.\n\nThe streets of downtown Petoskey are packed with boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses, many catering to the area’s tourists.

(Bridge photo by John Russell)\n\nBut with fewer year-round jobs available that allow a middle-class standard of living, the gap in these counties may only grow.\n\nConsider, for example, the schools.\n\nAccording to the Michigan Department of Education, rural Inland Lakes Schools in Cheboygan County spent about $8,500 per pupil in 2012-2013. About 20 miles due west, the more affluent Harbor Springs School District spent over $12,000 per pupil, allowing its students to learn in smaller classrooms, among other advantages.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Inland Lakes students qualify for free or reduced-priced lunch, a common measure of poverty, and the districts sends just over half its students to college. Harbor Springs’ poverty rate is half that of Inland Lakes; and Harbor Springs sends more than 8-in-10 of its students to college.\n\nGlimmers of change\n\nStill, amid economic challenge, there are some blueprints for progress, including some not so far away. Consider:\n\nJust outside Onaway, a town of about 900 residents in Presque Isle County, Tom Moran, owner of Moran Iron Works, was having trouble finding qualified welders for his growing business in Cheboygan County. A custom fabrication firm, its recent contracts include a $4 million order from Shepler’s Ferry to build a new ferry to Mackinac Island and a $50 million project for Consumer’s Energy to build a greenhouse-gas reduction duct. “They’re just not teaching this in the schools,” he said.\n\nSo last year Moran spent more than $1 million to open the Industrial Arts Institute in Onaway, an all-day, 15-week training program that teaches all aspects of welding. Fifteen students graduated in November. All got jobs.\n\nNetworks Northwest, the planning body that includes Emmet and Charlevoix, is planning this year to launch a $3,000 scholarship skills training program for 25 high school students, largely funded by a $65,000 grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. It will combine high school career technical training with community college class work and internships with area employees.\n\nThe Northern Lakes Economic Alliance, a business support group based in Boyne City, operates a mobile computer-controlled machining training lab, with 12 work stations, that can be driven to companies to train employees and high schools to bring students into 21st-Century entry-level manufacturing jobs.\n\nA few young professionals who left have returned, determined to forge a place in this region’s future. They include a former dance instructor who returned to buy a small bookstore in Harbor Springs, now flourishing, and a former ski racer and employee of the 2008 Obama campaign who came back to start an Internet business incubator.\n\nAt a crossroads\n\nThere is a common refrain among many of the young in this region: I like it here, but I may have to leave.\n\nDanielle Wager, 30, was born and raised in Charlevoix, graduating from Charlevoix High School and Grand Valley State University with a degree in education. She was hired in 2007 to teach social studies at Charlevoix High School but was laid off in 2009 amid budget cuts.\n\nThe Wager family The Wager family\n\nThe Charlevoix resident finally found work helping clients determine if they are eligible for welfare with the Michigan Department of Human Services, while her husband, Kreg, works as a child protective services specialist for the state. They have a daughter, Nila, 2, a mortgage and a tight budget on their $75,000 joint income.\n\n“I have been looking for a teaching job ever since I was laid off,” Danielle Wager said. “We're at the point where we are thinking of leaving the area or leaving the state. It's just so hard to find a good-paying job here, especially for someone who has an education.\n\n“We both grew up here. My husband is a big skier and snowmobiler. We love the small-town feel without being tiny.\n\n“But,” she asked, “can we afford to stay?”", "title": "Two Michigans gaze across a widening gap", "url": "http://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/two-michigans-gaze-across-widening-gap", "main": "http://www.bridgemi.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Knight Foundation, The Ford Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n“The Intersection” is bookended by separate pieces by Bridge reporter and Detroit history expert Bill McGraw. He begins with a tally of what some call a riot and others describe as a rebellion: in addition to the dead, the violence destroyed 690 buildings and left at least 388 displaced families.\n\nIt ends with McGraw’s haunting narrative about how the scars of those awful days still plague the family of Walter Scott III, the man who reportedly threw the first bottle during a police raid of an after-hours bar and gambling den, which helped spark the carnage.\n\nRELATED: Phil Power: \"1967 uprising feels like yesterday...\"\n\nOver eight chapters, some of Detroit’s most accomplished journalists explore the region’s racial divisions, including a poll that shows whites and blacks in the region still are far apart when it comes to views on police and groups such as Black Lives Matter. Most blacks said race affects their daily lives, but the same was not true for whites.\n\n“This tells us we all have work to do. We have not talked about racial issues because it's uncomfortable (especially for white people),” said Lester Graham, a reporter for Michigan Radio and Friday host of its Stateside show.\n\n“We need to talk about race. Nothing will change until we make that first effort.”\n\nThe Kerner Commission concluded the United States was “moving toward two societies, one black, one white ‒ separate and unequal.” It made numerous recommendations for reducing racial inequities, but the report was shelved, its policy recommendations never implemented.\n\nIn Detroit, it’s jarring to find so little progress since then, said Sandra Svoboda, special assignments manager for WDET, whose findings helped shape the project.\n\n“We were reporting these stories with this particular historical context at a time of unprecedented national conversation about race ‒ Obama's presidency, the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, Detroit's struggle with its so-called old and new identities, for example,” Svoboda said.\n\n“So this project reminded me of the way-overused adage about journalism being the first draft of history. This (book) is a first draft of today's history being written but yet a kind of next chapter if you will about what our society is.”\n\nStephen Henderson, the host of WDET’s “Detroit Today,” wrote in the book’s foreword about 12th Street and Clairmount, the west side crossing where the violence started.\n\n“It’s easy to stand at the corner where the disturbance began 50 years ago and conclude: we have fixed almost nothing, and we have learned even less,” he wrote. “But the work of this book shows what we do know, and what paths we need to follow to reshape that corner, this city and ourselves.”\n\nSee interviews with Detroit Journalism Cooperative reporters on a special episode of American Black Journal that airs Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Detroit Public Television.\n\nWatch a preview of the segment HERE.", "title": "‘The Intersection’ book explores race, rebellion and the damage done in 1967 Detroit", "url": "http://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/intersection-book-explores-race-rebellion-and-damage-done-1967", "main": "http://www.bridgemi.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake and the main proponent of RTW in the Legislature, said he intends to do just that — eventually.\n\nRight to Work prohibits the payment of union dues as a condition of employment. Workers who choose not to pay dues are still represented by union contracts.\n\nThe enthusiasm by business lobbying groups to make Michigan a RTW state has picked up since neighboring Indiana earlier this year became the first Great Lakes state to adopt the measure.\n\n“My top priority is to make Michigan the next labor freedom state,” Shirkey said on Wednesday, hours after voters defeated Proposal 2 by a 58 percent-to-42 percent margin.\n\nBut Shirkey said he faces an uphill battle because of opposition from many of his fellow lawmakers and, most significantly, from Gov. Rick Snyder.\n\nShirkey said he would introduce a RTW bill only “when I know for certain that I have the support of the governor.”\n\nThat support may not be forthcoming any time soon. Snyder told reporters Wednesday, as he has many times, that Right to Work legislation is not on his agenda. But he again wouldn’t say whether he would veto a bill, should it reach his desk.\n\nThe voter turn-down of the collective bargaining amendment is the latest in a growing line of significant public sector union defeats in recent years, including:\n\n• Failure in 2008 of the pro-labor Reform Michigan Government Now ballot issue.\n\n• The resounding defeat of labor-backed Virg Bernero as the Democratic candidate for governor in 2010.\n\n• The past two years of GOP victories in Lansing on business tax cuts and pension tax increases, as well as a wide variety of anti-labor government reforms from the end of dues check-off to increased public employee concessions.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor-backed group Progress Michigan, which sponsored Proposal 2, released a survey Wednesday it said found 70 percent of Michigan voters support collective bargaining rights, including 55 percent of those who voted against Proposal 2.\n\nThe poll of 500 Michigan voters was taken on Nov. 5 and 6.\n\nZack Pohl, executive director of Progress Michigan, said the poll was conducted to show lawmakers and others that Michigan residents would likely oppose Right to Work legislation.\n\n“Moving forward, any attempt by Lansing politicians to pass new laws that undermine (collective bargaining) would be a serious mistake,” he said.\n\nBut already on Wednesday, there was buzz among some Lansing observers and policy wonks about the possibility of “Right to Work Lite” – some sort of hybrid that could seek to weaken public sector unions while exempting the private sector and also possibly exempting police unions which, to some extent, sat on the sidelines of the Prop 2 battle. Some suggested there was even the possibility of a horse trade – support for conservatives’ Right to Work legislation in exchange for moderates’ gasoline tax increase to pay for road repairs; others, however, downplayed such talk.\n\nThe state’s leading organized voice for Right to Work legislation, the West Michigan Policy Forum, did not immediately seek to heighten the Right to Work issue Wednesday and instead chose to savor the defeat of the constitutional ballot measures.\n\n“First we had to defeat the ballot proposals to have a shot at any of our agenda items, including such issues as transportation funding,” said Jared Rodriguez, president of the West Michigan Policy Forum. “Moving forward, we are committed to working on our list of priorities. All of them.”\n\nPrivate-sector workers have collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act. State civil service workers have collective bargaining rights under state law. State police troopers and sergeants have had constitutionally protected collective bargaining rights since 1978.\n\nWhat now on home health?\n\nVoters on Tuesday also defeated Proposal 4, which would have re-instated limited collective bargaining rights to home health aides. Those rights were granted during the past administration of Gov. Jennifer Granholm, but removed by the current Legislature.\n\nDohn Hoyle, co-chairman of Citizens for Affordable Health Care, which sponsored Proposal 4, said in a statement that “senior and disability rights advocates across Michigan will continue our efforts to advocate for a strong registry that links home care recipients with trained home care providers who have passed criminal background checks.”\n\nLabor-backed groups spent $31.1 million in their effort to pass Proposals 2 and 4, while business-backed groups spent $31.5 million in a successful effort to defeat them, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network.\n\nOne labor expert said it would be a mistake to interpret the defeats as a sign of organized labor’s declining political power in Michigan, noting that all six proposals on the ballot went down.\n\n“It’s not clear to me that this says anything about the power of unions,” said Richard Block, a retired professor of labor and industrial relations at Michigan State University. “It suggests to me that the voters of Michigan are not particularly interested in amending the constitution.”\n\nBlock, who now works as a labor arbitrator, said voters also likely were disgusted by the sensational, misleading claims made by both sides on Proposals 2 and 4, and decided keep the status quo.\n\n“If you listened to any of the ads, they all said the sky was going to fall,” he said. “I think voters decided if the sky is going to fall, let it fall on a world I know rather than the one I don’t know.”\n\nBut Block said it was clear that the unions’ main interest in putting Proposal 2 on the ballot was to head off a right-to-work law. Their failure at the ballot box will likely put the issue on the front burner when a new Legislature convenes in January.\n\nSpokesman Ari Adler said House Speaker Jase Bolger backed off on taking RTW legislation earlier this year at Snyder’s request.\n\nBut organized labor’s decision to put Proposal 2 on the ballot and its subsequent defeat is a game-changer, Adler said.\n\n“The unions have opened the door to having this debate and the Speaker is happy to walk through it,” he said.\n\nRick Haglund has had a distinguished career covering Michigan business, economics and government at newspapers throughout the state.

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-18 06:00:00-04:00", "authors": [], "content": "A recent Talent 2025 study on labor force participation in west Michigan concluded that the three biggest barriers to workforce participation for families with modest incomes are poor access to reliable transportation, inadequate job skills and lack of affordable child care. Talent 2025 does not mince words: without improvements to our child care system – including streamlining onerous regulation for child care providers – the effect on Michigan’s economy will be “devastating.”\n\nKatharine Stevens, who leads the American Enterprise Institute’s early childhood program, states very clearly the importance of child care:\n\nWe need to pursue new approaches to build our nation’s human capital and ensure that all children have an equal chance to realize their full potential. High-quality child care that helps the country’s youngest, most disadvantaged children get a good start while enabling their parents to work is an especially promising strategy. Done right, it provides a powerful approach to breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty and advancing opportunity for two generations simultaneously.\n\nIn our state, we face major obstacles to doing child care right.\n\nMichigan families with incomes below 125 percent of the federal poverty level ($25,200 for a family of three) are eligible for a subsidy to help pay for child care. Michigan’s investment in the subsidy has fallen sharply in recent years, serving fewer than half of the children it served only ten years ago. Our state’s restrictive eligibility threshold is among the very lowest in the nation.\n\nPerhaps most disheartening, we deny tens of thousands of parents’ applications for the subsidy – and we’re not sure why. (State government is now looking into this issue and we applaud these efforts.)\n\nWhy do we – as business leaders – worry about child care? Because these parents are an essential part of the Michigan economy. They work hard to make better lives for their families. The child care subsidy allows them to grow and prosper in their jobs and model good work habits for their children. An inadequate subsidy means that child care may be unaffordable, forcing some parents to quit work because it does not provide enough income to offset the cost of child care. And taxpayers are short-changed because good child care is essential to helping parents become independent, working members of society.\n\nReliable child care is not just an issue for parents. When parents have a problem with child care and cannot get to work, this creates issues for employers. Shifts may end up understaffed. Employers may lose good employees in whom they have invested training dollars. In some regions of the state, unemployment has dropped to a level where many employers are struggling to find workers. A recent Crain’s Detroit Business article estimates that more affordable child care would “boost labor force participation for women by two percent” or 43,000 workers in Michigan.\n\nChild care providers, which are themselves businesses, also feel the pain. The state, largely with federal dollars, pays the subsidy for lower income children directly to child care providers. But just as Michigan restricts the number of families who are eligible for the subsidy, so too does it keep subsidy payments to providers low. Here again Michigan is among the very lowest in the nation. Low subsidy payments force many child care providers to turn away children or go out of business altogether; in fact, we are seeing a significant decline in the total number of child care providers licensed or registered with the state.\n\nAnd so the vicious cycle continues: even with the subsidy, many families cannot afford child care and many child care providers cannot afford to go into or stay in business. If the state were to increase the income threshold for eligibility for the subsidy and increase reimbursement to providers, we could begin to break the cycle. Fortunately, Governor Snyder has proposed to do the latter in his fiscal year 2017-18 budget proposal. We urge the legislature to support this.\n\nLabor shortages are constraining our state’s economic growth. Our members feel the talent gap. Affordable, quality child care reduces a major barrier to getting people into the workforce. In this way, eliminating child care as a barrier to employment is an essential tool in any meaningful economic development strategy.\n\nEditor’s note: The Center for Michigan, Bridge’s publisher, organized and provides staff assistance to the Children’s Leadership Council of Michigan.

It’s one thing to tweet as a candidate, or before Trump takes office, Mr. Earnest told reporters at a Monitor breakfast Wednesday. But it’s quite another, he said, once Trump becomes president.\n\n“One of the things that will be challenging is that it is apparent that the president-elect often sends tweets without consulting his team,” Earnest said, noting he was trying to be diplomatic. “And that has the potential to put Mr. Spicer in a difficult situation, if the tweets of the president-elect are not effectively coordinated with the public comments of his spokesperson.”\n\nTrump is an early riser – and early tweeter – which will make for an early start to the White House press office’s day. But Earnest, who has met with Spicer to show him the ropes of the how the press office works, suggested his successor is ready.\n\n\"Mr. Spicer strikes me as an early riser,” he said. “So I suspect that he is awake for a lot of those tweets.”\n\nEarnest also came armed with advice for the White House press corps, which is wary of possible changes – some dramatic – in how it operates. The Trump team has been considering kicking the press out of its West Wing digs, including work space and briefing room, and into a larger space nearby. That would be a dramatic break from more than 100 years of tradition, in which reporters have had ready access to the White House, if not senior officials.\n\nEarnest has stood firm in his belief that the press should continue to operate from the White House, both as an important symbol of an administration’s willingness to hold itself accountable and also for the press’s practical ability to do its job.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump said in an interview on Fox & Friends that he’s told his team not to move the press.\n\n“But some people in the press will not be able to get in,\" Trump added, a reflection of his tense relationship with the media. During the campaign, some reporters and news outlets were banned from his events.\n\nStill, Earnest told the breakfast group not to be “reflexively opposed to change.” Rather, he said, “consider proposed changes that are being put forward with an eye toward making sure that you’re protecting the core value of what it means to have an effective, informed, aggressive press corps that can be agents of the American people holding people in power accountable.”\n\nOne idea being floated by the Trump team is to have fewer briefings on camera. But Earnest declined to be specific. Speaking broadly, he noted an evolving media environment, with new platforms and social media available for an administration to get its message out. In the past eight years, Obama has spoken to bloggers, YouTube stars, late-night TV hosts, on podcasts, and in other new media, sometimes to the chagrin of traditional media outlets.\n\nReporters should keep an open mind, Earnest advises.\n\n“My point is, there’s a temptation in the press corps to assume that every time the Trump people are putting forward proposed change, there’s skepticism and even suspicion,” he told the Monitor after the breakfast. “In some cases, I think that suspicion is well placed, because of the kind of relationship and the rhetoric the president-elect has used.\"\n\nStill, he added, “I hope that there will be enough trust that’s built that there can be a constructive conversation about ways to make this process work even better.”\n\nAnother big question, as Obama prepares to return to private life, is how vocal he will be about Trump’s actions and policies. When asked, Earnest repeated his – and Obama’s – frequent assertions that the soon-to-be ex-president intends to honor the tradition of former presidents by refraining from public comment on the issues of the day.\n\nBut then he suggested Obama might flout that practice.\n\n“I think the president is also reserving the right, if he sees some very basic, central values and norms being violated, to speak out in defense of them,” Earnest said. “But it certainly is the president’s hope, and even his expectation, that he won’t have to do that.”\n\nDuring his breakfast with the press corps, Earnest was his usual cordial self, on message as ever, and defending his boss to the end, even after an election in which Obama actively campaigned for his heir apparent, Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump.\n\nThe Democratic agenda is popular, Earnest said, but “I think the president’s concern is Democrats haven’t made that case effectively.”\n\nEarnest’s loyalty to Obama is mutual. On Tuesday, the president interrupted his press secretary’s final White House briefing to sing the praises of a man he hired to work on his first presidential campaign from Iowa.\n\n“Of the folks that I’ve had the great joy and pleasure of working with over the last 10 years on this incredible journey, you know, this guy ranks as high as just about anybody I’ve worked with,” Obama said.\n\nAnd besides, who could resist a guy named Josh Earnest? “If someone is speaking on your behalf,” Obama said, it’s “a pretty good name to have.”", "title": "The importance of being Josh Earnest", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/monitor_breakfast/2017/0118/The-importance-of-being-Josh-Earnest", "main": "http://www.csmonitor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

But a new study suggests it died out tens of thousands of years before that.\n\nIf you are in the market for a new Tesla, now might be the time to buy\n\nArchaeological excavations are in progress at Liang Bua, a limestone cave on the Indonesian island of Flores.\n\nArchaeological excavations of Late Pleistocene deposits at Liang Bua in progress. The sediments shown being excavated are between 100 and 60 thousand years old and contain skeletal and behavioral evidence of Homo floresiensis.\n\nStrange human fossils unearthed over a decade ago on Indonesia's island of Flores revealed the existence of an ancient, petite species of human, dubbed Homo floresiensis and nicknamed \"hobbits.\"\n\nAt the time, researchers said that the unique, extinct, 3.5-foot-tall human may have lived as recently as 18,000 years ago, perhaps even 13,000 to 11,000 years ago. This would have made the newfound species the last remaining human other than Homo sapiens.\n\nBut now those dates have been revised. A new study argues those fossils are actually between 100,000 and 60,000 years old.\n\nRecommended: Are you scientifically literate? Take our quiz\n\nThe cause of the confusion? Erosion. Researchers date fossils like those of H. floresiensis by determining how long sediment has been covering specimens. Some layers around these fossils had eroded, making it seem as though the specimens had been deposited much more recently, say a team of scientists whose revised chronology was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\n\"The initial excavations were sampling very small areas,\" says study author Matthew W. Tocheri, a researcher at the Smithsonian's Human Origins Program, in a phone interview with The Christian Science Monitor. \"You don't get to see the full picture.\"\n\nIt's a lot like putting together a puzzle, says Dr. Tocheri, who also teaches anthropology at Canada's Lakehead University. \"If you only pull out two pieces and try to fit them together, a lot of the time the pictures that you make from that are going to be very different than after you've pulled out 15 or 20 pieces of the puzzle.\"\n\nAnd researchers have been pulling out more puzzle pieces over the past decade.\n\nEver since H. floresiensis skeletons and stone tools were first found at the Liang Bua cave on Flores, archaeologists have been searching for more fossils. The cave is quite large, Tocheri says, so scientists had a lot of ground to cover.\n\nAs excavations continued, it became clear that there was some sort of boundary in the sediment right around the layer in which the initial fossils were found. The researchers investigated further and found a stratigraphic unconformity, evidence that sediment had not been deposited continuously. And that missing layer was the key.\n\nExhaustive excavations\n\nBut the researchers had to be sure before they announced this revision to the world. \"This has really been going on for nine years,\" Tocheri says. \"By 2010 or 2011 it started to become much clearer that there was at least a stratigraphic unconformity, so it was a matter of trying to use as many dating methods as possible. We were trying to be as thorough as we possibly could.\"\n\nUltimately the team used stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, luminescence dating, uranium-series dating, and argon-argon dating to determine that the skeletal remains were in deposits dated between 100,000 and 60,000 years old and stone artifacts associated with these archaic humans fit somewhere between 190,000 to 50,000 years old.\n\n\"In many ways, science does correct itself. By continually investigating a site, you sometimes find minor errors that you made in the earlier interpretations and then you want to revise those interpretations,\" explains Russell L. Ciochon, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, who was not part of the study, in an interview with the Monitor.\n\n\"Although we think of determining the age of a site as just the simplest thing, it actually is pretty hard,\" says Michael Chazan, a paleoarcheologist at the University of Toronto who was also not part of this study.\n\nThese new findings constitute \"the kind of research we've been waiting for in terms of a really well done, pretty fundamental description of how the site formed,\" he tells the Monitor in an interview.\n\nTocheri simply says, \"It's part of the scientific process.\"\n\nEvolving a mysterious hobbit\n\nH. floresiensis is enigmatic in its own right, even with the revised dates.\n\nThe strange little archaic human has been nicknamed \"hobbit\" for its stature. But how did it come to be so small?\n\nTwo other human species are known to have reached the island region, H. erectus and our own species, H. sapiens. Both are significantly larger than the hobbits.\n\nScientists have suggested that this is a case of island dwarfism. In such a scenario, a human population would have arrived on the island large but shrunk over generations, thanks to evolutionary selection. Other animals, like elephants, have been found to undergo island dwarfism, but \"this is the only example we have of island dwarfing of a human lineage,\" says Dr. Ciochon.\n\nBut which species originally settled the island?\n\nH. floresiensis is morphologically similar to the older human species H. erectus, Tocheri says.\n\nFurthermore, the new dates refute any hypotheses that suggest H. floresiensis was descended from anatomically modern humans, as our species didn't make it to the region until around 50,000 years ago. Perhaps the two species interacted, he says, but currently the earliest evidence of H. sapiens on Flores is from about 11,000 years ago, long after the smaller species went extinct.\n\nAn alternate explanation is that \"Homo floresiensis is the descendant of another premodern species of Homo that may have been smaller-bodied and smaller-brained (e.g., like in African species attributed to early Homo) to begin with when it reached the island. Further discoveries of older hominin fossils on Flores and elsewhere in Asia are needed to resolve these questions about the ancestry of Homo floresiensis,\" Tocheri writes in an email to the Monitor.\n\nThe researchers point out that the revised dates apply to this site and these fossils, but if H. floresiensis fossils are discovered elsewhere, they might be younger.\n\n\"If there was a book that chronicled the entire evolutionary history of Homo floresiensis, then it would be like we have only a few tattered and torn pages with the rest of the pages missing (but hopefully not lost forever!),\" Tocheri writes.\n\nRegardless, H. floresiensis \"highlights how much variation there probably was in the human family tree,\" Daniel Lieberman, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard University who was not part of the study, tells the Monitor in an email.\n\n\"Our genetic diversity as a family group was far more greater in the past than it is today. And that's from a genetic perspective, that's from a morphological perspective, it's from a behavioral perspective,\" Tocheri says. \"It's easy for us to forget because we're the only ones left that can pontificate about what it means to be human.\"", "title": "Did 'hobbit' people go extinct earlier than we thought?", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/0330/Did-hobbit-people-go-extinct-earlier-than-we-thought", "main": "http://www.csmonitor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

The somewhat surprising results only add to the clamor for a deeper conservation drive.\n\nNetflix nears 100 million subscribers: Why that doesn't mean the end of cable TV\n\nIf you are in the market for a new Tesla, now might be the time to buy\n\nA mangrove plant grows on a shore in Cancun June 21, 2010. In the 40 years since Cancun was founded, countless acres of mangrove forests up and down Mexico's Caribbean Coast have been lost - and the destruction continues. Now many scientists say that mangrove forests can help slow climate change, and are desperate to save them.\n\nMangroves, “botanical amphibians” that occupy a world on the cusp of land and sea, have long been considered a neglected, under-appreciated form of forest, providing untold services for nature and mankind alike.\n\nA new study, published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, considers one increasingly crucial attribute – the ability to store carbon – comparing the aptitude of mangroves along coastal deserts with their more lush, tropical counterparts.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers studied mangroves’ ability to harbor carbon below ground, in the sediment peat layer, and the somewhat surprising results only add to the clamor for a deeper conservation drive, highlighting humanity's interest in doing so.\n\nRecommended: 5 environmental wins to celebrate\n\n\"Mangroves represent a thin layer between ocean and land, and yet we are seeing an ecosystem that is storing a lot of carbon in a very small area,\" said Paula Ezcurra, lead author of the study and a former researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, in a press release.\n\nMs. Ezcurra and her colleagues studied the mangrove systems at two desert lagoons and two lusher, more tropical ones, delving deep beneath the mangled root systems to extract sediment samples.\n\nTheir work revealed a layer of non-decomposed roots, or peat, dating back two millennia, which acts as a sponge, soaking up atmospheric carbon.\n\nAnd the results? They found that the desert systems stored up to five times more carbon below ground than their more tropical counterparts. The coastal desert mangroves they were studying, in Baja California, constitute a mere one percent of the land area, but store almost 30 percent of the region’s belowground carbon.\n\nYet there was more to it: mangroves on the rugged, rocky coastline were found to have built a far deeper layer of peat than their cousins on the flat coastal floodplains – the latter having been forced to migrate in response to sea level rise.\n\n\"The results show how these ecosystems have been adapting to climate change and sea-level rise for thousands of years,\" said Octavio Aburto-Oropeza, assistant professor at the Scripps Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation. “Understanding the link between the natural history and carbon storage capacity of mangrove environments could give us insight into future climate change and sea-level rise.”\n\nEven without considering these underground carbon storage facilities, created by countless generations of mangroves, the live biomass of mangroves is of huge importance to the world’s carbon balance, too.\n\nIn fact, on average, mangroves have double the amount of live biomass compared with tropical forests in general.\n\n“Mangrove forests are among the most carbon-rich habitats on the planet,” writes Mark Spalding, a senior marine scientist at The Nature Conservancy. “Although they occupy just a fraction of the world’s surface, they pack a punch.”\n\nYet, as with most of the world’s forests, mankind has been poor stewards of these vital ecosystems, eradicating them by three percent each year.\n\nBut as this work emphasizes, with mangrove forests, their removal robs humanity of an incredibly efficient natural remedy to carbon emissions. Moreover, as their destruction normally sweeps away the peat in its wake, that rich store of carbon, held in check for thousands of years, is released once more into the atmosphere.\n\n\"Our study helps to further quantify the value of mangrove forest ecosystems, and highlights the importance of mangrove conservation,\" said Exequiel Ezcurra, an adjunct professor at Scripps and professor of botany and plant sciences at the University of California, Riverside.\n\n\"Hopefully it will serve to underscore the urgent need for mangrove protection and for the serious appraisal of the environmental services provided by common-access resources.\"", "title": "Desert mangroves: stars of carbon sequestration", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/0330/Desert-mangroves-stars-of-carbon-sequestration", "main": "http://www.csmonitor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Why? Some key South American powers have recently exchanged populist or corruption-plagued governments for more stable and regionally active ones, he says.\n\n“The Obama administration was very cautious on Venezuela to avoid stoking anti-American sentiments,” Carothers says. “But especially now with new governments in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, and with increased attention to Venezuela’s crisis from Mexico, there’s an opportunity for this [Trump] administration to step up its multilateral game plan and work with others on Venezuela.”\n\nOne reason for the sudden urgency in outside efforts to encourage political resolution in Venezuela is the increasingly violent turn that almost daily antigovernment demonstrations are taking. On Wednesday, Maduro sent Army troops to the streets to quell what organizers touted as the “mother of all protests.” One person, a teenage boy, died after being shot near the site of the protests, but the source of the gunfire was in dispute.\n\nFor Washington, working with allies and partners to support democracy and human rights in their region is not new, but the practice has spread as more countries adhere to democratic norms and universal rights. As one example, the US worked with a strengthened ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) as a partner in its efforts to cajole Myanmar (also known as Burma) to transition from military dictatorship to emerging democracy.\n\nVenezuela has been gradually closing democratic avenues and concentrating powers in the executive since the socialist firebrand Hugo Chávez rose to power in 1999. But where President Chávez survived on charisma and high oil prices (Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves) his hapless successor, Nicolás Maduro, has foundered under the oil-price collapse and an economy in free fall.\n\nVenezuela’s sovereignty-sensitive neighbors looked the other way as Mr. Maduro strong-armed his way to increasingly authoritarian rule, packing the country’s Supreme Court and disregarding the National Assembly, which the opposition won in a landslide last year.\n\nSignals from Trump administration\n\nBut the neighborly indifference has suddenly given way to regional activism – to Maduro’s surprise as much as anyone else’s, it seems.\n\nAfter Venezuela’s Supreme Court last month grabbed legislative powers from what it considers a “rebellious” National Assembly, a regional uproar led by the long-somnolent Organization of American States prompted Maduro to reverse the court’s decision. Neighboring countries have stepped up pressure on Maduro as street protests have expanded and complaints of chronic food shortages have turned into reports of widespread hunger and steep rises in infant mortality.\n\nIt’s that environment of increased regional activism that analysts say the Trump administration could seize upon to address Venezuela’s crisis.\n\nAlready Mr. Trump and some members of his team have demonstrated somewhat keener interest in human rights issues than many foreign policy experts anticipated.\n\nTrump surprised many by launching airstrikes in Syria over the use of chemical weapons, saying the “civilized” world could not leave such barbarity unanswered. And this week Washington’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called a UN Security Council session with the sole purpose of reviewing the state of human rights globally – something the council had never done before.\n\nOn the other hand, the Trump administration skipped a session in March of the well-regarded Inter-American Human Rights Commission – the first time in two decades the US had missed a commission hearing.\n\nSome analysts say that the way Trump proceeds on Venezuela could offer a template for how the administration will move on other crises that challenge US leadership and values, but are not at the level of national-security risk posed by North Korea or Iran.\n\nRegional awakening\n\nSo far, the administration has not done much on Venezuela, but that may be changing.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump decreed that sanctions be imposed against Venezuela’s vice president, Tareck al-Aissami, whom the US Treasury has declared a “narcotics kingpin” in a cocaine smuggling ring. In February, Trump received at the White House the wife of jailed Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo López – tweeting out a photo after the meeting and saying Mr. López should be released “immediately.”\n\nBut some see an uptick in attention on the horizon. Next week Trump will host Argentine President Mauricio Macri for a meeting the White House says will focus in part on “the deteriorating situation in Venezuela.” Last month Trump addressed Venezuela with Peru’s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski during his White House visit. And this week State Department officials are in Peru with an agenda that includes discussion of Venezuela.\n\nStill, some experts say they’ve seen little of substance. “You might say there’s been some new toughness towards Venezuela, but that’s mostly a matter of style and tone,” says Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “What we haven’t seen yet is any sign of a real strategy.”\n\nWhat is cause for hope, Dr. Shifter says, is the same awakening among Latin American democracies that Carnegie’s Carothers cites. “The good news is that Latin American governments are starting to wake up to the horror happening in Venezuela, and are wanting to do something about it,” Shifter says. “That’s a development the US should be able to work with.”\n\nCaracas rejects 'interventionist' call\n\nCarothers says the US should broadly stick to two avenues for addressing Venezuela. One is to use America’s bully pulpit, “to speak up at regular intervals and especially forcefully when bad things happen,” like usurping the National Assembly. The other is to make the issue a priority of US relations with the region’s democracies.\n\nNo one is overly optimistic that Maduro will listen to his Latin neighbors and move to bring Venezuela’s crisis to a close any time soon. On Tuesday his foreign minister, Delcy Rodriguez, rejected as “interventionist” a call from 11 Latin American countries for Venezuela to “ensure the right to peaceful protest” and release a timetable for delayed regional elections.\n\nBut Shifter says strengthened relations between the US and the region and sustained evidence the Trump administration values multilateral cooperation could be a key to addressing the humanitarian stain that Venezuela has become in the region.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Instead, it means reimagining the battlefield with smart materials and connectivity in mind.\n\nImagine robotic tanks that maneuver themselves across desert terrain, avoiding land mines; drones with enough artificial intelligence to carry out strikes without human operators; and next-generation uniforms to monitor soldiers' heart rates and hydration levels or provide early warning alarms for chemical attacks.\n\n“If I’m wearing a uniform that informs me when there is a chemical attack,\" says Richard Danzig, the former US Navy Secretary, \"that's a very valuable attribute.”\n\nBut all this expanded connectivity and technology brings a host of risks, too, says Mr. Danzig, who wrote a paper on this subject for the Center for a New American Security called \"Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Reducing the National Security Risks of America’s Cyber Dependencies.\" For one, creating Wi-Fi enabled uniforms and weapons could give America's enemies many new digital targets. If malicious hackers can manipulate sensors to fake chemical attacks, he says, \"those false signals can be debilitating.\"\n\nThe Army says it's well aware of the cybersecurity risks in a more-connected battlefield, and it's building out its new platform with security in mind.\n\nAccording to its March 3 notice seeking bids on the Internet of Battlefield Things project, the Army said cybersecurity must be \"inherent\" in the planning. Indeed, cybersecurity threats in a connected war zone are triple fold. For example, enemies could potentially hack sensors to direct a tank away from their own combatants, command it to self-destruct, or enter bogus data that tricks US forces into thinking the defunct vehicle is operating just fine.\n\nBeyond just tampering, more software on the front lines also means that the military has to solve the problem of powering the technology that it deploys.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of connectivity.

He sees the military first expanding the Internet of Things into areas of supplies and personnel management because the back office powers the front lines.\n\n\"If troops can't get supplied correctly, then they won't be able to fight,\" Carter notes.", "title": "A more connected military means new battlefield glitches, too", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2017/0331/A-more-connected-military-means-new-battlefield-glitches-too", "main": "http://www.csmonitor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Wind has eroded sediments with a harder layer on top that forms a protective cap as the wind erodes softer and sandier sediment below. These pinnacles, just a few centimeters high, are small-scale versions of what are sometimes termed 'hoodoos.'\n\n—Last August, a small group of scientists set out for some routine fieldwork at Slims River, which feeds Kluane Lake, the largest glacially fed body of water in northwest Canada's Yukon Territory. When they arrived at the site of the fieldwork, however, the 15-mile long river had all but vanished, with only a thin trickle of water remaining where 10-foot depths had been common only a month before.\n\nThe scientists reviewed satellite data and other measurements and found that the river had vanished over a stunningly fast four days – between May 26 and 29 – in an unprecedented modern example of a geological phenomenon known as \"river piracy.\"\n\nThe scientists determined that the climate-change related receding of the Kaskawulsh Glacier, the source of Slims River, was responsible for the sudden disappearance. In a study released Tuesday, the researchers noted that the glacier had shrunk to a point where its water was entirely redirected towards the Kaskawulsh River, which was usually fed by the glacier along with Slims.\n\n\"River piracy in this context means one river taking water from another in some unplanned sort of way,\" Mark Davis, senior research fellow and director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans, tells The Christian Science Monitor via email. \"It is a metaphor,\" he adds.\n\nMr. Davis tells the Monitor that this kind of sudden shift is probably not unprecedented, since glaciers and rivers are naturally dynamic, responding to the ebb and flow of weather patterns and temperatures. Still, the disappearance of a whole river in less than a week took the researchers by surprise.\n\n\"Geologists have seen river piracy, but nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,\" said lead author Dan Shugar in a statement from the University of Washington Tacoma. \"People had looked at the geological record – thousands or millions of years ago – not the 21st century, where it's happening under our noses.\"\n\nAt its widest points, Slims River spanned 150 meters (492 feet), carrying water from the glacier into the Kluane Lake, which then eventually flowed into the Yukon River toward the Bering Sea. This pattern remained unchanged for centuries, until Kaskawulsh Glacier retreated under a period of intense melting during the record-breaking temperatures of 2016.\n\n\"What we found was the glacial lake that fed Slims River had actually changed its outlet,\" Dr. Shugar said in the statement. \"A 30-meter (100-foot) canyon had been carved through the terminus of the glacier. Meltwater was flowing through that canyon from one lake into another glacial lake, almost like when you see champagne poured into glasses that are stacked in a pyramid.\"\n\nThe abrupt shift in water flow has already had significant environmental repercussions. The now nearly dry riverbed has exposed once-watery sediment to the open air, causing dust storms in the region. Kluane Lake has also seen a drop in water level, leaving vacation cabin docks high and dry in the Yukon's largest lake, a popular tourist destination.\n\nAccording to the study, which was published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the research team used satellite data to determine that the sudden river piracy was a direct affect of climate change driven by the addition of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from industrial sources, accelerating the glacier's continuous retreat since the end of the Little Ice Age the 1800s.\n\nSo can we expect glacial rivers to disappear elsewhere? Not necessarily, according to Shugar – river piracy on this timescale is still very rare. But that doesn't mean there is no cause for concern – ice melts have already led to rising oceans and other negative environmental consequences of human-caused climate change.\n\n\"So far, a lot of the scientific work surrounding glaciers and climate change has been focused on sea-level rise,\" Shugar said in the statement. \"Our study shows there may be other underappreciated, unanticipated effects of glacial retreat.\"\n\nInitiatives like the Paris Agreement, aimed at reducing the world's carbon emissions, are helping to minimize further problems associated with ice melt. But in the meantime, there's not much the average person can do beyond educating themselves about the climate and responding to these sorts of issues as they occur, says Davis.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

These things are already happening, but are often harder to pin down since there is not a catchy phrase to sum them up and because the range and scale of impacts is much larger and harder to deal with.\"\n\n\"Glaciers are hard things to boss around,\" Davis adds.", "title": "How climate change dried up a Canadian glacier river in a matter of days", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2017/0418/How-climate-change-dried-up-a-Canadian-glacier-river-in-a-matter-of-days", "main": "http://www.csmonitor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

But the National Front leader has been under pressure since the start of April as conservative Francois Fillon and far-leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon closed the gap on the favorites.\n\nSpeaking to a rally in Paris on Monday, she vowed to suspend all immigration with an immediate moratorium, shield voters from globalization and strengthen security. Those subjects won her her core backing, and she hopes it can give her boost with about 30 percent of voters still undecided.\n\n\"For several weeks, we will need to assess the situation. The reality is that immigration is massive in our country and that migration flood that we are experiencing is not a fantasy,\" Le Pen told RTL radio on Tuesday as she fleshed out details of the moratorium announcement.\n\nThe measure has not been part of her program, although she has put on record that she wants to limit annual immigration to just 10,000 people a year.\n\n\"I will carry out this moratorium for the exact purpose of implementing this 10,000 figure,\" she said.\n\nUntil now, Le Pen has struggled to get her opponents in the presidential race to debate her party's trademark tough security and immigration stance. She, by contrast, has been put on the defensive over her position on leaving the euro zone, a proposal that lacks wide support.\n\nTwo polls on Tuesday showed Mr. Fillon and Mr. Melenchon still a few percentage points away from Le Pen and Mr. Macron. She would be beaten by any of the three others in a run-off, polls have repeatedly shown.\n\nLe Pen's stance on immigration mainly competes with that of former prime minister Fillon, who despite being plagued by a financial scandal is slowly recovering in the polls, and has also targeted far-right voters.\n\nFillon told Europe 1 radio on Tuesday that Le Pen's moratorium idea was nonsensical, and that while numbers should come down, the key was to impose the country's values and identity.\n\n\"Immigration must be regulated because we have an economic, social and housing situation that doesn't enable us to welcome as many people who want to come here,\" Fillon said.\n\n\"(But) a moratorium makes no sense. What threatens us is not immigration, but the surrender of our values and our history. If we are proud of our history and defend it, then we will integrate foreigners more easily.\"\n\nSecurity, which Le Pen links closely to immigration, was threatening to once again become a campaign issue on Tuesday after two men were arrested in Marseille, in southern France, on suspicion of planning an attack during the voting.\n\nMore than 230 people have died in militant Islamist attacks over the past two years, mostly at the hands of home-grown jihadists, often of north African descent.\n\nHowever, with no major attacks on French soil since last summer, polls show that unemployment, stuck around 10 percent, and political integrity – an issue that has arisen after accusations of nepotism leveled at Fillon in particular since early this year – are bigger issues for voters.\n\nSarkozy, Juppe back Fillon\n\nDespite his recovery, Fillon is arguably in fourth place. One of Tuesday's four opinion polls put him on a lower score than Melenchon, as several others have done in past days and weeks. Those that pit him against the far-left showman in the second round show him losing that battle by a big margin.\n\nFormer President Nicolas Sarkozy, a divisive figure whose backing may be a mixed blessing for Fillon, on Tuesday urged voters to back the man who served under him as prime minister from 2007 to 2012, and who beat him to the party nomination in November.\n\n\"He has the experience, the desire and the project that will allow France to ensure an alternative to the last five disastrous years that we have experienced, (under Socialist president Francois Hollande)\" Mr. Sarkozy said in a video message posted on Facebook – a rare foray into the campaign by him.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Many would argue that they succeeded, even if it is unknowable.\n\nAs uncomfortable as it may be, we need to recognize foreign interference in our free and fair election system. Russia modernized its cold war disinformation campaign apparatus with social media platforms to achieve unprecedented scale for its campaigns of influence. The Kremlin exploits the best attributes of the internet – that anyone can be a publisher and can potentially reach everyone – to create divisions for Russia’s political goals. Social media – once promised as a force to democratize the world through the free and unfettered flow of information – is now distributing extreme content that could pose a significant threat to democracies everywhere.\n\nRussian-backed extremist movements could present formidable challenges in elections this year in Western democracies including France and Germany. The Kremlin playbook follows the classic foreign influence recipe of disinformatica (spreading fake news stories) and kompromat (shaming individuals through public release of private information) to drive wedge issues while preying on some of our basest human emotions, values, and beliefs..\n\nWe must reconsider traditional foreign policy in light of foreign interference in the internet age. The internet is the great equalizer because of its ability to connect anyone to everyone. It can be used for good or for evil. With antiglobalization sentiment growing with the Brexit referendum and the US election, we can no longer stand idly by as democracy, globalization, and free trade face strong headwinds in Western Europe.\n\nThe new tools of the trade are the automated mass disinformation campaigns perpetrated by paid social media propagandists and amplified by bots. Proxy hacker groups are used to steal, manipulate, and publish damaging information via outlets such as WikiLeaks and its politically motivated document dumps to manipulate public sentiment. Not to mention the threat of destructive malware attacks such as the alleged North Korean attacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nSo, what can be done and whose job is it to address these new threats? Most cybersecurity professionals are not experts in foreign policy and geopolitics. Likewise, most foreign policy experts are not cybersecurity experts. However, to address these challenges, governments, private companies, and individuals must begin working together to build more resilient digital systems and the ability to monitor how these digital systems may be exploited for nefarious purposes. However, these checks and balances cannot throw out constitutionally guaranteed rights such as the First Amendment right to free speech either.\n\nTraditional nation-state hacking focuses on stealing sensitive data for intelligence collection. The new playbooks attack constitutional processes such as free and fair elections. Democracies will need to define boundaries for what constitutes intelligence collection versus nation-on-nation cyber or information warfare. This means not only defining the rules but also enforcing them – and responding to attacks with the full extent of government powers from diplomacy, economic sanctions, and law enforcement to military action. For the US, it means naming and shaming adversaries when we have strong evidence of complicity, and then holding them publicly accountable. The Obama administration’s strong response to Russia’s election interference with economic and diplomatic sanctions is a first step, but we still lack a clear policy framework for defining the bounds of where cyberespionage ends and sabotage begins. What is acceptable and what constitutes an act of war?\n\nPrivate companies and individuals must play an essential role, too. Fake news via social media is a massive problem, which the private sector is uniquely capable of addressing. Social media companies, which already employ machine learning for face recognition, can apply machine learning and crowdsource its user base to fact check and grade for accuracy. At the same time however, we must ensure that fact-checking efforts don’t drift into the territory of censorship. We need our best entrepreneurs thinking about these problems.\n\nDemocracy doesn’t guarantee that everyone will be pleased with election outcomes; democracy does provide for certain freedoms and rights along with a system to cast our ballots in free and fair elections. In establishing the US republic with an Electoral College system and a separate House and Senate, the founders recognized that for democracy to be functional, it needed an educated body to balance the threats that might exploit the process to subvert it.\n\nThe most robust defense is a well informed and critically thinking electorate that votes at the polls. For cybersecurity professionals, we have a higher calling now – one to protect the nation from foreign governments or other forces of corruption or deception who are exploiting the internet and social media in order to unseat democracies globally.\n\nAnup Ghosh is founder and chief executive officer of Invincea, a Sophos company.", "title": "Opinion: How to counter the Kremlin's hacking playbook", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2017/0329/Opinion-How-to-counter-the-Kremlin-s-hacking-playbook", "main": "http://www.csmonitor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

The Ethiopian government, which is one of the East African countries serving under AMISOM mission, is perceived to be Somalia’s long-standing enemy and entered the country for retaliation, a perspective shared by many Somalis living around the world.\n\nRecent actions as well have given fuel to these accusations.

Sukhoi noted in its press release, \"Speaking about the PAK FA program, the deputy defense minister said that serial production of T-50 fifth-generation aircraft is scheduled to start in 2018.\"\n\nThe announcement that serial production will start in 2018 indicates that either a delay occurred with the program or previous reports about it going into production in 2017 were premature. In January of this year, Viktor Bondarev, the Commander of the Russian Aerospace Force, told RIA Novosti that \"next year the aircraft goes into serial production,\" and he reiterated that expectation last month.\n\nThe PAK FA, like other advanced fighter jets being developed around the world, has encountered its fair share of difficulties that have pushed the aircraft's entry into service back in the past. A joint project with India regarding a variant of the PAK FA has been similarly plagued by setbacks.\n\nMoscow's financial troubles have also negatively impacted the fighter program. Economic sanctions and the collapse in energy prices have reduced the government's revenues, forcing Russia to cut some expenditure and dip into reserve funds to ease the situation. As a result, plans for large orders have been scaled back, with an initial order likely to be no more than 12 aircraft, after earlier hopes that many more would be procured.\n\nDespite the challenges the program continues to move forward. An eighth prototype fully meeting the military's requirements took flight on June 20. Several more prototypes are nearing completion currently and likely to see air testing before the end of this year.\n\nIn all, over 700 flight tests have been carried out to date, according to Sukhoi, and some of these tests include the use of guided missiles and other weapons systems. During testing in February, one of the prototype aircraft reportedly set a climb record of 384 meters per second.\n\nThe United Aircraft Corporation, the parent of Sukhoi, had hoped to receive an initial contract for the aircraft as early as this year, though with the latest announcement that serial production will not be until 2018, an order will likely come some time in 2017. Expectations of acquiring over 50 PAK FAs by 2020 are unlikely to be met, particularly if the financial situation does not improve.\n\nEven after entering service, the aircraft will still not be to full capability for some time. In particular, the engines currently in installed on the aircraft are the same ones used by the Su-35 – which fuels some of the criticism that the PAK FA is not a true fifth-generation fighter – and while a new engine is being developed specifically for the PAK FA, it is not expected to be ready for testing until 2018 and will not enter service until 2025 at the earliest.\n\nNevertheless, completing the PAK FA will serve as a milestone for the Russian industry, which can boast of developing an advanced stealth fighter of a purely Russian design. Moreover, if nothing else, Russian firms can use the experience of developing a new fighter jet from scratch as the basis for future projects down the line, such as a sixth-generation fighter.\n\nImportantly for the Russian military, the aircraft if procured in sizable quantities can give the Aerospace Force a challenge to the United States' F-22 Raptor. While Moscow's budget is likely to prove problematic in the short term, Russia is currently paying off debts (rather than accumulating them) and working to ease off its vulnerability to sanctions from abroad, particularly from the West. Continued effort in this end could certainly improve the budget picture down the road.\n\nIn the longer term, procurement of the fighter jet in bigger numbers may become feasible, assuming the PAK FA meets the capabilities as advertised, which either way will become apparent once the initial batch enters service as the military will run the aircraft through its own exercises.", "title": "Articles — Conflict News", "url": "http://www.conflict-news.com/articles/?author=572a67ee356fb04a1f6eaf14", "main": "http://www.conflict-news.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "The Syrian Civil War has been raging now for more than four years, and in that time, despite a few close calls, there have been no large-scale interventions of foreign ground forces in the country. This however, is all about to change. The Russian Federation, over the past few months has massively ramped-up the level of support which it providing to the Assad Government in Syria, and appears to be building up the ability to conduct offensive operations within the country. But what equipment are they sending and what does this say about their plans for Syria?\n\nInitial indications that Russia had changed its level of involvement in the Syrian conflict appeared last month when a number of Russian ships began delivering hidden cargo to the country’s naval base in Tartous. Around the same time, video footage and images began to appear online of Russian soldiers deployed to Syria, which many speculated were military advisers.\n\nWhile this was alarming on its own, and drew international attention, it was just the beginning. In the last few weeks the Russian Air Force has been conducting daily cargo flights to airbases in Latakia. These flights have been delivering a number of advanced combat systems which appear, by all accounts, to be intended for use in offensive operations by Russian forces themselves.\n\nSome of the these advanced systems being deployed include T-90 main battle tanks, as well as the advanced new BTR-82a infantry fighting vehicles and at least one R-166-0.5 electronic warfare and communications vehicle. These systems which have been sighted both on the ground and reportedly in satellite imagery are indisputably of Russian origin, and not in use by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlChgcFnGFU\n\nHybrid war or full-scale intervention?\n\nCurrently, estimates put the number of Russian soldiers in Syria in the low thousands, with more arriving daily. Knowing this, it is still difficult to assess just how large in scale Russia’s intervention in the conflict will be.\n\nOne important question that needs to be analyzed is whether Russia will follow its (reasonably) successful strategy of ‘hybrid war’ where it semi-covertly backs local forces without taking an official lead role. Until recently this looked to be the case, with official denials from Putin’s government that Russian soldiers were involved in direct fighting within the country.\n\nHowever, the situation is developing quickly and it is appearing more and more likely that Russian troops are building up to take a more overt role in the conflict. Comments by the Russian leadership that they would help out Assad militarily “if there is a request” indicate that any pretense of mere ‘support’ for the Syrian regime will soon be dropped.\n\nThis satellite image leaves no doubt that Russia is throwing troops and aircraft into Syria. http://t.co/kLvnlygqZ3 pic.twitter.com/ThKPdpSvZ8 — Foreign Policy (@ForeignPolicy) September 16, 2015\n\nInternational Response\n\nSo far, aside from expressions of meaningless ‘deep concern’ towards these deployments, other major international players in the conflict have remained muted in their response. This will likely change if and when Russian troops begin to see more active combat within the country. Should they begin to turn the tide in certain regions against the rebel forces which Putin and Assad label as “terrorists and extremists”, the backers of these rebel groups could respond.\n\nPrimarily, Turkey and the Gulf States are poised to increase the supply of arms to their favoured rebel groups. As well as increasing the quantity of these supplies, these countries could also supply rebels with more advanced weaponry such as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), for example the US-made Stinger missile, which was an alleged game-changer during the Soviet/Afghan War.\n\nIf this does not prove to be enough, Turkey could be put under pressure to use its ground forces to establish a much-hyped ‘safe zone’ in the north of Syria. Such a move would bring NATO and Russian forces into a possible dangerous confrontation within the country.\n\nKnowing these possible international responses it is likely that for the time being Russia will tread carefully with its forces in Syria, and use them to attack isolated rebel positions as well as to generally halt existing rebel advances – especially in Latakia and the Al-Ghab plain. The last thing an economically-strained Russia wants is to risk the Syrian Civil War becoming an international one.", "title": "Articles — Conflict News", "url": "http://www.conflict-news.com/articles/?tag=Turkey", "main": "http://www.conflict-news.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "In the hours preceding Christmas Eve, Afghan forces were able to fend off Taliban sieges in the Sangin District, killing a “Taliban commander and 50 fighters.” Nonetheless, the district, located in Afghanistan's strategic Helmand Province, could not have been rid of Taliban presence without US and British airstrikes and air support backing Afghan reinforcements.\n\nSince this incident in the Sangin District, and since the recent deaths of six Americans in an attack just outside of Bagram Air Base, President Obama’s vow to significantly reduce the number of US troops in Afghanistan has again become a prominent component of US foreign policy--with 9,800 slated to stay in the region into most of 2016, and 5,500 to be deployed beyond the president’s departure from office.\n\nU.S. Deputy Representative to the United Nations Michele Sison spoke at the Security Council on December 21st, reiterating the fact that while US forces will still be present, the primary focus is to establish Afghan forces to fight the Taliban.\n\n“Our message to these forces is clear – there is only one path to peace, security, and stability in Afghanistan. And that path is not through military action – but through an Afghan-led reconciliation that builds upon the democratic and human rights gains the country has made since 2001. The Taliban’s attacks harm the Afghan people, destabilize the country, and betray the group’s disregard for the lives of the Afghan people. They must stop.”\n\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter also echoed sentiments of US-Afghan partnership in a December 18 press conference in Jalalabad, despite this being the longest war in American history:\n\n“[...] as groups like ISIL emerge on the battlefield, or al-Qaeda seeks to reestablish a safe haven, we must be prepared to deter their growth and counter the threats they pose. We will be prepared to do that. They can never have a secure base here in Nangarhar or anywhere else in Afghanistan.”\n\nEven with 14 years of United States support and backing for Afghan forces, there are still gaps in areas like intelligence, special forces, logistics, aviation, and “ministerial development.”\n\nPart of the difficulty in regions like Afghanistan is that the battlefields are “dynamic,” in the sense that there are many emerging and reemerging groups in different areas of the country. From a US foreign policy perspective, a dynamic field just makes it more troublesome to pursue a troop withdrawal. Rather than focusing on properly training and equipping Afghan forces to be self-sustaining, we see constant shifts in aid and forces that follow the movements of enemies within the country.\n\n“From al-Qaeda and various different parts of the Taliban movement to groups like the IMU that have been around for a long time, [...] these groups are constantly reconstituting themselves, reorganizing themselves, and accordingly, they show different behaviors and different -- attention at different times, different parts of the Afghan geography,” said Carter. “Therefore, Minister Stanekzai and I were talking about this today, the Afghan security forces with our help are getting more and more agile.”\n\nDespite the fact that the president promised to end the Afghan war in 2014, it is clear that due to recent events, new developments in terror, and the progress of the Afghan forces, a complete US troop withdrawal in the near future is nothing but wishful thinking.", "title": "Articles — Conflict News", "url": "http://www.conflict-news.com/articles/?tag=Islamic+State", "main": "http://www.conflict-news.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

This being said, another bloody incident in this increasingly deadly war has thrust the country back into the spotlight. This morning Houthi-aligned forces fired a barrage of OTR-21 Tochka ballistic missiles at Arab Coalition forces in the Yemeni town of Ma’rib. These heavy ballistic missiles caused catastrophic damage to those targeted, with at least 22 UAE soldiers confirmed dead, and another 25 allied local fighters killed. This combined with the deaths of 5 Bahraini soldiers in separate incident of cross border fighting on the Yemen/Saudi Arabian border, makes today the deadliest yet for the Arab Coalition.\n\nBut what has changed that has enabled the Houthis and elements of the Yemeni Army to strike back so hard? Conflict News spoke to Sanaa resident and security analyst Hisham Al-Omeisy to find out more about these developments.\n\nTochka missile that was launched into #Saudi #UAE newly base in East Marib #Yemen Watch http://t.co/GkxEWK7AIz pic.twitter.com/XOPItCWyAC — Hussain Albukhaiti (@HussainBukhaiti) September 4, 2015\n\nRegarding the Houthis losses of territory in the south of Yemen, especially around Aden, following the arrival of Emirati ground troops, he explains that the Houthis have effectively made a tactical retreat.\n\n“They lost areas to the Popular Resistance that are exactly along the lines separating North and South Yemen,” Al-Omeisy said, explaining that the Houthis have retreated to areas where they enjoy greater support.\n\n“[The Houthis] were hemorrhaging a lot of soldiers, a lot of money and munitions, so to a lot of people they were cutting their losses.”\n\nRegarding today’s deadly missile attack he believes it came as a preemptive strike against the Coalition forces. After a number of failed offensives into areas of strong Houthi support, the UAE, KSA and their Yemeni allies had gathered a large force of tanks, AFVs and soldiers in Ma’rib as a staging point to attack Sanaa. This force was reportedly being touted as sufficient to take Sanaa “in only a few days”.\n\n“Marib has been reinforced heavily by the Coalition. They were basically building a huge force to in Ma’rib, so that from Ma’rib, they could come and invade the capital.” Al-Omeisy explains.\n\n“So today, when the Houthis attacked Ma’rib, it came as a surprise to a lot of people, because people expected […] this force to move into Sanaa, not the other way around[…] It was basically a huge slap to the coalition forces.”\n\nWhile the long-term outcomes of this attack still remain to be seen, it is important to note that the Houthis have continued to be able to conduct large-scale attacks without outside resupply. Rather, through their alliance with large elements of the Yemeni Army, they have access to a large amount of stockpiled weapons, such as the Tochka missiles used with devastating effect today. Despite widespread allegations of Iranian supplied weapons being used in the conflict, this is not confirmed by sources on the ground.\n\n“It’s mostly stock they had previously, especially now they are working with the Yemeni Army which basically had access to warehouses – that is why they had those advanced weapons, in addition to those they confiscated from their opposition – weapons dropped to the Resistance,” Hisham says.\n\n“But there is no evidence that they have been resupplied, or been given weapons by outside forces, like Iran for instance.”\n\nCritical to the outcome of this war will be the way in which the Gulf States that form the Coalition intervening in Yemen deal with their rising military death tolls. If this causes domestic political problems for them the war could soon see a negotiated political settlement, however should it enrage these countries into a yet greater level of involvement, the war will drag on, and may yet worsen.", "title": "Articles — Conflict News", "url": "http://www.conflict-news.com/articles/?tag=UAE", "main": "http://www.conflict-news.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

But these military actions take on a new gravity considering the vast and secret powers Trump inherited.\n\nFormer President Obama escalated the use of drone strikes — including in non-battlefield arenas such as Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen — so it is no surprise that President Trump has continued with abandon. While Obama put some constraints on drones, Trump gave the secretive, unaccountable CIA new authority to conduct drone strikes against “suspected militants.”\n\nSpecifically, President Obama’s constraints on drones included that targets pose an “imminent threat,” that their capture is “not feasible,” and that there be “near certainty” civilians will not be injured or killed. However, Obama didn’t always hew closely to his own policy, which evolved throughout his Presidency as legitimate criticism of drone strikes increased.\n\nOne of the most famous Americans targeted and killed by a drone, al Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, met none of the early purported criteria. Still, the Justice Department under Obama maintained that the President had the unilateral authority to target and kill American citizens like al-Awlaki. That power now rests with President Trump who has undertaken aggressive and messy military actions in the early days of his presidency.\n\nTrump has pushed for a $54 billion increase in defense spending. Americans can expect Trump will use their money for expensive military actions like the botched raid in Yemen that killed innocent women and children and an American soldier and resulted in destruction of a $75 million military helicopter. Or, for decisions that upend years of international relations policy, such as launching 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria. (Replacing them will probably cost at least $1 million per missile).\n\nFearing the Buzzing Drone\n\nThis does not bode well for the millions of people living under the daily buzz of U.S. military drones. The power to target and kill using drone strikes went too unchecked in the Obama administration because we “trusted” him.\n\nAlthough small pockets of national security, civil liberties, and peace groups complained about the Trust Doctrine, which seemed to apply to the most controversial conduct in which our country was engaged — from torture to surveillance to drone operations – people in positions of power were generally unwilling or unable to imagine what this power would look like in the hands of someone unpredictable, petty, and vengeful.\n\nThe Obama administration exalted the drone program’s “surgical precision,” the internal checks and balances built in, and the careful calculations before taking strikes. Because many saw Obama as a reasonable, intelligent President and capable leader who won the Nobel Peace Prize, Americans too calmly and too quietly accepted the secret killing practices being waged halfway around the world from U.S. Air Force bases in our backyards in Nevada and California.\n\nThe drone program is plagued by secrecy and unaccountability. That was true even before Trump put strike authority with the CIA and possibly relaxed civilian kill standards. Several whistleblowers have come forward to point out abusive practices and high turnover within the program, misleading government statements on the accuracy of strikes and targeting capabilities, and an overall pressure to launch strikes while falsely presenting the propagandist narrative that drone warfare allows precision targeting with no harmful effects at home in the U.S. This false narrative persists because politicians want us to believe it — and so do we.\n\nWe opened Pandora’s box and unleashed drones upon humankind. But in this case, the damage was entirely foreseeable.\n\nJesselyn Radack is a national security and human rights attorney who heads the “Whistleblower & Source Protection” project at ExposeFacts.

The exception was the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), founded in 1969 to promote a neo-fascist, ultranationalist program. Its fortunes bear close watching as a clue to Turkey’s political direction.\n\nThe MHP and its paramilitary wing, the Grey Wolves, were among the leaders of Turkey’s death squad violence against leftist intellectuals, academics, and Kurdish activists in the 1970s and 1980s. In return, right-wing state security forces protected their organized criminal operations, including drug trafficking. One associate of the Grey Wolves, Mehmet Ali Agca, was convicted of trying to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981.\n\nA New York Times reporter at that time described the MHP’s followers as a “xenophobic, fanatically nationalist, neofascist network steeped in violence.” The party’s U.S.-trained leader helped execute a successful military coup in 1960, and by 1980 was implicated in smuggling heroin into Western Europe.\n\nTurkish Prime Minster (now President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan broke the back of that “deep state” alliance of secret intelligence, criminal, and right-wing forces through mass purges and indictments in 2008. Last year, however, he made up with many of these former opponents, making them allies of his own increasingly authoritarian government and his military adventures in Syria and Iraq.\n\nOne winner in that realignment was the MHP. Like the National Front in France, the MHP has shed many of its extremist positions in recent years to join the mainstream of respectable politics in Turkey.\n\nStill, its racist roots were exposed to full public view in 2015, when Grey Wolves members attacked a South Korean tourist in Istanbul and hung banners saying “We crave Chinese blood” to protest Beijing’s crackdown on Turkic separatists. The MHP’s leader, Devlet Bahceli, defended his street supporters, saying “how are you going to differentiate between Korean and Chinese? They both have slanted eyes. Does it really matter?”\n\nAs an advocate of ethnic Turkish supremacy, moreover, the MHP remains violently opposed to making any concessions to Kurdish separatists, and denounced Erdogan for starting peace talks with them in 2013.\n\nAllies Against the Kurds\n\nTwo years later, Erdogan reversed course and began waging total war against the Kurds, both at home and in Syria. That set the stage for a tacit alliance between his ruling party, the AKP, and the MHP.\n\nGrey Wolves thugs attacked offices of the opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party, which supports the rights of Kurds and other political minorities. Senior MHP officials, along with members of their youth organization, also joined the fighting in Syria to support ethnic Turks against the Assad government and Syrian Kurds. Remarked one Turkish journalist, “The ultranationalists are the most fertile pool for secret operations.”\n\nEven with his opponents cowering or imprisoned under a state of emergency declared after a failed military coup last year, Erdogan needed the MHP, which holds 36 seats in the 550-member parliament, to win approval of the constitutional amendments at issue in Sunday’s referendum. MHP officials reportedly hope to earn seats in the president’s new cabinet.\n\nMHP leader Bahceli hailed Sunday’s vote to grant President Erdogan immense new powers as “a very significant achievement” and the “final word” for the future of “the great Turkish nation.” The head of the Grey Wolves vowed that his followers would “take up our arms and fight if necessary” to defend the outcome.\n\nFighting may indeed become inevitable if opponents, backed by foreign election observers, continue to contest the referendum vote.\n\n“Even if they are demoralized in their defeat, Erdogan’s project will arouse significant resistance among the various ‘No’ camps,” comments Steven Cook, a Mideast expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The predictable result will be the continuation of the purge that has been going on since even before last July’s failed coup including more arrests and the additional delegitimization of Erdogan’s parliamentary opposition. All of this will further destabilize Turkish politics.”\n\nIt remains to be seen how the Trump administration will deal with Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian regime and aggressive foreign policy. President Trump’s first national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, took more than half a million dollars from a pro-Erdogan Turkish businessman to promote Ankara’s interests. Flynn was also joined by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes for a private meeting at Trump Hotel in Washington with Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavu?o?lu on Jan. 18.\n\nMore important than secret lobbying activity, however, is the strategic importance of U.S. access to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, from which U.S. warplanes launch attacks in Syria. The base also houses some 50 hydrogen bombs for NATO, giving Washington all the more reason to stay friendly with the Turkish government.\n\nBut if Erdogan and his new allies among Turkey’s ultranationalist right continue to make new enemies at home and abroad, the Trump administration will need to rethink the viability of continuing to rely on Ankara to make possible continued military intervention in the Middle East.\n\nJonathan Marshall is author of “Turkey’s Revival of a Dirty ‘Deep State’”, “Turkey’s Nukes: A Sum of All Fears,” and “Coups Inside NATO: A Disturbing History.”", "title": "Erdogan’s Neo-Fascist Turkish Allies – Consortiumnews", "url": "https://consortiumnews.com/2017/04/19/erdogans-neo-fascist-turkish-allies/", "main": "https://consortiumnews.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

That proposal was raised by U.K. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and affirmed by Tillerson but rejected by all other G7 members. With that resounding defeat, Tillerson had no sticks from “the international community” to wield as an ultimatum against the Russians, telling them to get behind a U.S.-imposed “regime change” in Syria or suffer the consequences of further economic isolation from the West.\n\nTillerson also carried little in the way of carrots, given President Trump’s retreat on his campaign pledges to improve relations with Russia. Tillerson’s empty diplomatic bag was a topic discussed on Russian prime-time television the evening before his arrival. Senior Duma member and United Russia Party leader Vyacheslav Nikonov rhetorically demanded of Tillerson on the Evening with Vladimir Solovyov talk show: “So, make us an offer of what it means to go with America, what it brings us, and then we will consider it.”\n\nIn effect, Nikonov was calling the Trump administration’s bluff. He and the Russian elites understand perfectly that Donald Trump has no political capital to spend to get Congressional approval of normalized relations with Russia.\n\nJust as the Tillerson-Putin meeting was taking place on Wednesday, another widely watched Russian talk show First Studio on the Pervy Kanal state channel opened with host Artyom Sheinin posing a baiting question to the American journalist Michael Bohm, a frequent visitor to the program who is often used as a punching bag. Referring to Tillerson’s initial meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the doubt that Putin would grant Tillerson a meeting, Sheinin said, “I believe there is the practice in big corporations for a new visitor who has come to see the boss to first undergo a ‘screening interview.’ It looks as if Tillerson passed this screening process and so he was allowed in to speak to the boss. Do you think this was a positive thing?”\n\nIn other words, the Russians knew that Tillerson came with empty hands and that he was the suitor, not the one being wooed. Tillerson came to discuss reinstatement of the Memorandum of Understanding on Deconfliction in Syria because on the U.S. side there was great concern over Russia’s refusal now to speak at the regional level to U.S. military counterparts and avert clashes on the ground and in the air that could lead to escalation of confrontation and possibly to all-out-war. The Russian withdrawal from the deconfliction arrangement following the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian airfield on April 6 put the continuation of U.S.-led military operations against Islamic State militants inside Syria in danger.\n\nOn April 8, senior Pentagon officials were denying that the Russians had severed all military-to-military hot lines, but there was a cold sweat in Washington. The uncertainty over whether Syrian and Russian air defenses might take aim at NATO aircraft had already led the Belgians to publicly announce cessation of all their flights within the U.S.-led anti-terror coalition. Presumably other NATO members had come to the same conclusion.\n\nMeanwhile, my information backchannels indicate that the Russians set down their preconditions for reinstatement of the deconfliction arrangements: no further U.S. air attacks on Syrian government positions. We may be sure that this was the major subject for discussion and possible agreement during Tillerson’s talks with Putin.\n\nThe result may be something similar to the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 when the U.S. claimed victory publicly as the Soviets pulled their missiles out of Cuba, but privately the U.S. had granted what Moscow had wanted, the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. But Putin is no Nikita Khrushchev, who lost prestige among his Kremlin peers for striking the agreement with the Americans; Putin is likely to gain stature from such an arrangement.\n\nThe U.S. Media’s Take\n\nMeanwhile, the mainstream U.S. media presented the Putin-Tillerson meeting in relatively neutral terms given the American press corps general hostility to all things Russian. The Washington Post did better than other media outlets, with Moscow Bureau Chief David Filipov and his colleague covering the State Department in Washington highlighting the undeniable fact that the parties were “sharply at odds” and noting:\n\n“Russia made it clear it was unwilling to roll back its strategic alliance with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The talks appeared unlikely to bring any significant breakthroughs after last week’s missile strike plunged U.S. relations to one of the lowest points since the Cold War. But despite the growing rifts, some general compromises were discussed.”\n\nThe areas of potential compromise were possible reinstatement of the information-sharing “deconfliction” Memorandum of Understanding with the United States that the Russians suspended immediately after the April 6 missile attack and creation of a U.S.-Russian working group to find ways to ease tensions between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\nAfter that, the authors moved on to more trivial pursuits such as Donald Trump’s latest remarks about Assad being “an animal.” However, even amidst this swill there were a few points worthy of note because they gave expression to Russian policy positions at the talks: Russia’s refusal to accept ultimatums, such as Tillerson brought with him over choosing ties with the U.S. or Syria; Russia’s rejection of the allegations that Assad was behind the chemical attack in Idlib; Russia’s call for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to investigate the use of chemical weapons there; and Putin’s likening the present situation to the one immediately preceding the U.S. invasion of Iraq. All of these important points are presented in the article at face value, alongside U.S., U.K. and other Western accusations directed against Russia\n\nThe New York Times coverage gave more attention to American action than to Russian reaction, as the opening of its cover headline for its several related articles indicates: “U.S. Pressures Russia …” The sub-article dealing with the Tillerson visit devotes more attention to what came before and after Putin’s meeting with Tillerson than to what they may have agreed on. The Times bureau chief David Sanger noted how Tillerson was held in suspense as his anticipated meeting with Putin was left in doubt until the last minute, what was described as a typical maneuver by the Russian president to keep his interlocutors off balance, a characterization which ignores the widely reported urgings of Russia’s talking heads before Tillerson’s arrival that their President not receive him because of the objectionable message on Syria that he had laid out on Monday at the meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Italy.\n\nIndeed, the Times article said almost nothing about what may have justified the Putin meeting and what was agreed other than the working group to ease tensions, which Sanger correctly identifies as devoted to small and not the big divisive issues.\n\nGilbert Doctorow is a Brussels-based political analyst.

We are in the age of Trump. And this possesses interesting and multiple challenges. And I know that the farmworkers are up for that and there are many plans being made. But I really would like to take a moment for you to remind us about Cesar Chavez. Tell us about who the man was, and the significance of the work, because obviously it’s going to continue to resonate. And we’re going to talk about that in a moment. But, please let’s remember him, for the moment.\n\nArturo Rodriguez: Cesar Chavez, he was like anyone else, he was determined, he devoted his whole life towards working on behalf of the poorest of the poor of the farmworkers. He, himself, his family, they all were a part of the migrant farmworkers stream throughout the state of California, and other areas as well, the state of Oregon, and so forth.\n\nHe realized at a very young age that he did not want to continue to see people mistreated, and abused, and exploited, and have to go through what his family did, and what his mom and dad did, and his brothers and sisters. So he made a decision early on in his life that someday he wanted to tackle that, and to do the best that he could do and make a contribution towards bettering the life and the respect and dignity for the women and the men that harvest our fruits and vegetables, Dennis.\n\nDB: And so, here it is, 2017, Trump is clearly… he is like the classical white supremacist. Not only is he that in theory, but […] when it comes to imposing the kind of policies that reflect his racism, he hasn’t wasted any time. So, could you just talk a little bit about what’s been happening in the trenches with the United Farm Workers? How you all have been acting, preparing, planning, and fighting back?\n\nAR: Well, Dennis, it’s a very good question, and we’re extremely disappointed, in terms of what the Trump administration has done, and the decisions that they’ve been making, and the way that they call out immigrants in this country and make them feel like they’re not here to make a contribution, which is just the opposite. We would not be the nation we are today without the hard work, and the sacrifice, and the contribution that immigrant workers make to our nation.\n\nAnd so, we have been, along with all of our sister organizations, the Cesar Chavez Foundation, the UFW Foundation and other organizations, have been doing everything we can to, first of all, ensure and educate workers, farmworkers, throughout various states, what their rights are as immigrants, what their opportunities are, how they can defend themselves.\n\nAnd we’ve set up a special organization, the UFW Foundation, which has a number of offices throughout the state of California, right now, and Arizona, to go out and to be available, to have representatives that are certified by the federal government, in order to deal with issues around immigration. And we’ve been working with networks of attorneys throughout all the various rural communities, to ensure that, in the event that farmworkers are picked up, or anyone, any immigrant is picked up in the rural communities, that they can immediately contact us, and we can get in touch with attorneys to be able to assist them. And to provide them the guidance that they need, and the reassurance. And get in touch with their families and help them go through the process. And, hopefully, avoid them being sent across the border. And so, that’s been a major part of our work these last few months.\n\nBut, in addition to that, we know, at the same time we need to bring people together, Dennis. And, we need to continue to demonstrate to the federal government, to demonstrate to the Trump administration, that we are continuing the fight, to make sure that farmworkers, that immigrants are protected in this nation. And so, we decided to celebrate the anniversary of Cesar Chavez’s birthday with a series of events.\n\nAnd we’re […] coordinating activities in seven different states: Florida, Texas, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. To get people engaged, to get people participating, and making sure that, again, everybody is aware what their rights are, but demonstrate the unity that exists with us.\n\nAnd we’re bringing together our sisters and brothers from the Muslim community, and many of the other immigrant communities, so that we can all act united, especially throughout these rural communities which, oftentimes, they’re not taken into account because of all the activities that take place in our urban centers. But it’s very, very important for us to do that.\n\n[…]\n\nWe want to send a strong message to Donald Trump that we are here to stay. That we make a contribution to America, and that’s why we came here to begin with, as immigrants, as farmworkers, to be able to ensure that we have a viable agricultural industry that continues to dominate the world in the production of fruits and vegetables, throughout our nation, and throughout our state.\n\nDB: Now, it’s really important that we come to you to make sure we keep a human face on this story. And we know in your position as head, President of the United Farm Workers a lot of stories are coming through your desk. And can you just share a couple of stories that can help the people who aren’t experiencing this understand how dangerous it feels now? And the kinds of pressures–it’s sort of this pressure, it’s this policy of “brutalize them so much, hit them so hard, come at them from so many different directions, that they will, as they like to say ‘self deport’.” You want to just keep that human face on it, for a moment?\n\nAR: Sure, of course, Dennis. I think about, right now, in terms of what happened in McFarland, California, it’s about three weeks ago now. Where workers were going to work, early in the morning, and they noticed that there was a car that was parked along the side. And it wasn’t marked. And the next thing they know that they were being stopped and it turned out to be ICE agents. And there was four individuals there in the car. And, as a result, the ICE agents asked them all for their papers, and whether they had legal status here in the country or not. And immediately, obviously the workers… no\n\nmatter how much you try to share with them the importance of not saying anything, it’s a difficult situation when somebody approaches you with a gun, and you don’t know exactly what to do. And you feel the intimidation and the coercion, and a sense of fear there. And so, they were very honest and upfront with the ICE agents.\n\nAnd, as a result of that, before we knew it, within 24 hours, two of them had already been deported to Nogales, Mexico. And so we never got a chance to really help those individuals, but we were successful in helping two other folks.\n\nAnd we’ve set up in Kern County, the third largest agricultural county in the United States today. And that’s where Bakersfield is at, Dennis, and McFarland, and Delano, and many of the other rural communities are, and Lamont and so forth. And so, we’re working there with a network of attorneys, and they have a group of about twenty attorneys that are there helping and assisting anybody that needs legal help. And they’re going out and doing these information sessions across the county, to really remind people, in terms of what’s happening. But, again, that was an incident that just recently happened.\n\nWe have another situation in Delano, California, where a worker was taking his daughter to school one morning and, again, an ICE agent stopped him on the way and asked him for his papers and so, immediately, he had to call someone to pick up his daughter, because they were going to take him in. And as a result, again, we had to step in and assist that particular worker in regards to the situation he was confronted with there, with the ICE agents.\n\nDB: How old was his daughter?\n\nAR: She was in the elementary school, so about nine, ten, at that age.\n\nDB: There’s an experience, right?\n\nAR: It’s a very, very scary situation. And we constantly hear people telling us, “Look, we don’t want to go out. We’re fearful about going any place other [than] work.” And so, folks are making other arrangements, for their children to be picked up from school, or from babysitters. They’re not going shopping like they used to anymore. There are a lot of things that they are staying away from, Dennis, because of the fact that there’s that fear there right now that exists. And, the life in these communities, especially in these rural areas where farmworkers live and work at, it’s just completely different from what it used to be, prior to the Donald Trump administration.\n\nDB: Now, in terms of the formal actions, what is the California Legislature doing? I know there’s a number of actions happening, in terms of legal representation for undocumented folks, all kinds of things around standing up against any kind of registry. Have you weighed-in on some of this stuff? Do you think there needs to be expanded legal support for the workers that you represent, and for the undocumented folks who are facing this head on, now?\n\nAR: [California] Senate President Kevin de Leon, and so many of the other, good Latino legislators, and others as well, are very empathetic as to what is happening out here to immigrants. They’re fighting hard. They’re trying to do everything they can, within their power, within the state of California. As we all know, though, the unfortunate thing is that immigration is a federal issue, and so we can’t do anything to really deal with the core issue, and that’s bringing about immigration reform. But, certainly there’s a lot of efforts being made to enhance the amount of legal representation that’s available for immigrants in the event they’re picked up by ICE agents.\n\nAnd, as you well know, Dennis, there’s a big fight against the federal government, against the Trump administration, regarding their action on sanctuary cities. And there’s at least discussion in terms of, why don’t we make the State of California a sanctuary state because of the large number of immigrants that are here, both in our rural and urban communities. And the importance they are for the economy of this state, especially within the agricultural industry, and the retail industry, the hotel industry, construction, yard maintenance, and things of that nature.\n\nSo we’re definitely working alongside legislators in any way we possibly can to bring testimony and bring, like you said, a living face to what’s happening out there to folks. And trying to ensure that people really do understand the importance of this. This is just not something we can, kind of, sweep under the rug, or something we can ignore because it impacts the lives of people that are very, very important to our society.\n\nDB: And, will Trump’s policies, in terms of trade, and the border and his quest to hire American, is that already beginning to reverberate? How do you see that?\n\nAR: Oh, definitely. I mean, there’s no doubt. The workers that go back to Mexico, for whatever reason, for family reasons, or whatever. They’re not coming back anymore, those workers that work in agriculture. And so, we see definitely that in the agricultural market that, because of that, growers are finally being forced to deal with some of the issues that they should have dealt with a long time ago. And that’s it. They’re having to raise wages, they’re having to provide some better opportunities for workers, in regards to the working conditions or regards to hours of work, or their wage rates, and things of that nature. I think, yes, it is having an impact.\n\nAnd it’s having a very negative impact on the flow of immigrants here into the United States, which are definitely needed for our agricultural industry. That just no longer is occurring, Dennis. And I think it’s very much of a tragedy for the American consumer because we’ve found, time and again, no matter what we do, that very few Americans, if any, actually want to go to work in the fields, in the agricultural fields, and be a part of that. And they’re not professionals at it, they’re not skilled at it, and they’re not willing to tolerate the difficult conditions and make the necessary sacrifices, and so forth.\n\nDB: Alright, well we really want to thank you, Arturo Rodriguez, for taking the time out, again, to speak with us, and celebrate Cesar Chavez’s life, his birthday. We miss him, it’s been 24 years since his passing, but I know that the United Farm Workers, as we talked about, is not going to forget about it. And people can go to the United Farm Workers web site […] to follow all these activities, to get involved.\n\nAR: I do want to mention one story. This is happening in an urban community, right in your audience’s area, your listenership’s area, in San Jose. And there is a family there that, I won’t mention the names of them cause I don’t want to embarrass them, but it was so great to go on our apps today and look at, and see one of the stories on Facebook actually, that’s being shared by a family that has their children making sandwiches to take out to the farmworkers there in the field. And what a way to celebrate the day of Cesar Chavez, for children to be doing something like that. And I thought if we could just communicate that to children throughout the state, what a blessing that would be for farmworkers obviously because they’re getting food. But also it brings to light the importance, the role the farmworker plays in our society.\n\nAnd I just thought that was such a heartwarming story. That the parents of the three children, cause I know the family, and they do this on their own. And they’re not looking for recognition, they’re not looking to be recognized in any particular way. But this is the way that they’re bringing up their children, so that their children really understand the contribution that farmworkers make to our society.\n\nAnd that today is the day that we celebrate Cesar Chavez’s birthday, it’s a day to celebrate the work that farmworkers do in this state, in California, and throughout the country. And so, we want to really thank the family that really has that practice, and I just think it’s such a great example, for what all of us could be doing with our children on this day.\n\nDB: And it’s poignant, of course, because we have heard too many stories of farmworkers who pick the foods that make the table so beautiful and appealing, and can’t even afford to buy them. So there’s a lot to think about there. Again, we thank you, Arturo Rodriguez, President of the United Farm Workers, for being with us on this celebration, this birthday of Cesar Chavez, March 31st. Thanks for being with us. Be careful. We’ll talk to you soon.\n\nAR: Thank you very much. We appreciate the opportunity to be with you all and thank you for all the good work that you all do in terms of educating and informing your listeners and readers.. We very much appreciate it. Si se puede, and happy Cesar Chavez day.\n\nDennis J Bernstein is a host of “Flashpoints” on the Pacifica radio network and the author of Special Ed: Voices from a Hidden Classroom.

Isaacs — quietly explains.\n\nArnold R. Isaacs\n\nFor anyone seeking to better understand the recent past and present chaos in the Arab world, here’s a tip: read Generation Revolution. To be clear, this book does not report on the broad sweep of recent history, or on the entire region. It examines that history through the experiences of a small number of young men and women navigating the last tumultuous decade in one country, Egypt.\n\nThe author, British journalist Rachel Aspden, carefully avoids generalizing. For the most part, she lets her protagonists’ stories speak for themselves. But those stories, full of compelling detail, give a vivid sense of the conflicting forces that propelled upheavals not only in Egypt but across a wide swath of the Middle East.\n\nAspden arrived in Cairo in the summer of 2003, a 23-year-old brand-new university graduate hoping to learn Arabic and find adventure. As she came to know her Egyptian contemporaries, young men and women of her generation whose world was interconnected in ways their parents could not have imagined, she began to see the complex and contradictory currents that were shaping their lives.\n\nAs one of many examples, here’s what Aspden writes about a young woman from a middle-class family who was almost exactly her own age:\n\n“However well-off their families, Cairo’s twenty-first-century twenty-somethings still inhabited a world of arranged marriages, dowries, virginity, filial obedience and religious obligation. But the old rules were only part of the story. Her generation had grown up with Internet porn, Hollywood rom-coms, women’s magazines, illicit nightclubs, mobile phones and social-media flirtations. They’d also grown up with the revival of conservative Islam, the spread of headscarves and prayer bruises — marks sported by men who pressed their foreheads ostentatiously hard to the ground in worship — sexual harassment and mass unemployment. All these currents collided in the world of relationships and marriage. The confusion was driving young people crazy.”\n\nInitially, Aspden found it paradoxical that many — though not all — of the educated young people she met were drawn to conservative religious beliefs and practice, rather than seeking greater personal freedoms. But she came to see that turning to religion was another form of rebellion, “an act of defiance against their parents’ generation and the unjust, corrupt society they had helped create.” It was also a way to a better, cleaner identity. One of her subjects, a young man she calls Ayman, explained it to her this way:\n\n“People like us were brought up in a Westernized way, let’s say 80% Westernized…. We went to English-language schools, we watched American TV, all that stuff. And many people just continue on that path. But why should we adopt the mindset of the West? As far as I’m concerned there are three mindsets: Western, Eastern and religious. The first two are both rubbish, both bad in their own ways…. Western — do anything you want, no boundaries, make money, exploit women, consume. Eastern — oppress women, corruption, ignorant traditions, stuck in the past.”\n\nRather than accept either of those, Ayman went on, he chose to listen to an inner voice he knew had better answers: “God put something inside you that will guide you to the truth, if you’re seeking it sincerely.”\n\nIn describing this and many other conversations, Aspden’s reporting makes another very important point: that the Islamic revival of the last four decades has been anything but a simple story of fundamentalism vs. modernism. Instead she shows that Islamism in Egypt has taken many different forms, some fanatically reactionary and intolerant and some trying to find ways to reconcile strong religious belief with life in a modern, diverse world.\n\nIn particular it is worth pointing out that her observations completely undercut the argument of American anti-Muslim activists who portray the Muslim Brotherhood as a violent terrorist organization. The Brotherhood, Egypt’s most significant Islamist movement, is shown in these pages as repressive and theocratic but not violently extremist.\n\n“The Brotherhood aren’t using violence, they’re using democracy, but the word is ‘using,'” a more liberal Islamist told Aspden, adding: “using is different from believing. They are using democratic actions to pursue a fundamentalist vision.” When Aspden asked what that vision was, he replied, “The dream of the supremacy of Islam.”\n\nWhether that nonviolent character will change now that the Brotherhood is once again being suppressed is one of many critical questions that will only be answered in coming years.\n\nFour-Year Lapse\n\nAspden left Cairo in 2005, then returned in 2011, the year that began with huge anti-government protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak and touched off a turbulent chain of events: the Muslim Brotherhood’s rise to power, a continuing cycle of protests and repression, and the return to military rule under Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after a coup d’etat in the summer of 2013 that led to even harsher repression including a military assault that killed as many as 1,000 pro-Brotherhood demonstrators in the streets of Cairo in the aftermath of the coup.\n\nAgain, Aspden portrays those events largely through the experiences of a small group of acquaintances, including many of the same men and women she knew from her earlier Egyptian stay. And again, those experiences are rich in telling moments that help explain a complicated history, illuminating issues and social divisions that are still far from resolved.\n\nNarrow as its lens may be, Generation Revolution represents journalism at its best — an exceptional piece of reporting on a vitally important subject. This valuable book should be on the required reading list for policymakers and opinionmakers concerned with Middle East policy and violent extremism.\n\nA conventional review would end here. This one carries a postscript, on an episode that departs from the author’s main theme but touches on another important one. It occurred in an exchange with the brother of one of her principal protagonists, a few months before Aspden left Egypt for the second time.\n\nWhen their conversation turned to the Islamic State, which he called by its Arabic name, Daesh, the young man told her that it has the support of many Egyptians who “believe they’re fighting to protect Islam.” Then he added: “We don’t know that Daesh are real. There’s no proof of what’s really going on there, and there’s a lot of manipulation by the Western media… Hollywood tricks. Those beheading videos could easily be faked in a studio.”\n\nAspden had heard that argument before. She was “frustrated,” she writes, “by the baroque conspiracy theories voiced by clever, educated people, and they in turn were disappointed by my weak-minded general belief in events reported by the BBC, New York Times or Guardian.”\n\n“What do you think is the truth, then?” she asked Mazen’s brother.\n\n“For me it’s obvious,” he replied. “Daesh has been created by Israel and the United States to discredit Muslims and provide the West with another excuse to invade and seize the oil.”\n\nWhat sounded to Aspden like “a fringe conspiracy theory,” she writes, “was, in Egypt, a generally accepted truth. When I switched on my computer at home, my friends were sharing a cartoon of an Islamic State jihadi puppet operated by the figures of a leering, hook-nosed Jew and Uncle Sam.”\n\nAt a moment when “fake news” has become a major concern, that passage teaches a chilling lesson not about Egypt but about our own public discussion. It tells us that politicians and their mouthpieces and partisan pontificators who push out false information do not just strengthen their own lies. They strengthen their enemies’ lies as well, because weakening truth weakens it for everybody.\n\nAspden’s Egyptian acquaintances who are sure the Islamic State is an American-Israeli hoax (and who scoff at her for trusting the BBC and the New York Times) — are the mirror image of Americans who believe other falsehoods — for example that “we don’t know who is coming in” as refugees, or that a vast Muslim conspiracy is infiltrating the U.S. legal system to impose sharia law — and who scoff at the identical news organizations and everyone else who reports facts they don’t like.\n\nThe more effectively one side undermines public trust in journalists or scientists or scholars who present real facts, the easier it becomes for those on the other side to distrust those sources too, and deny facts that are inconsistent with their reality. It may not be one of the lessons Aspden set out to teach in this book, but it is definitely worth thinking about.\n\nArnold R.

The campaign’s structure, the authors write, was an ‘unholy mess, fraught with tangled lines of authority, petty jealousies, and no sense of greater purpose.’”\n\nThe book portrays Hillary Clinton as distant from her campaign staff, accessible primarily through her close aide, Huma Abedin, and thus creating warring factions within her bloated operation.\n\nAccording to the Journal’s review by Barton Swaim, the book’s authors suggest that this chaos resulted from “the fact that Mrs. Clinton didn’t know why she wanted to be president. At one point no fewer than 10 senior aides were working on her campaign announcement speech, not one had a clear understanding of why Americans should cast their vote for Mrs. Clinton and not someone else. The speech, when she finally delivered it, was a flop – aimless, boring, devoid of much beyond bromides.”\n\nThe book cites a second reason for Clinton’s dismal performance – her team’s reliance on analytics rather than on reaching out to real voters and their concerns.\n\nThere is also an interesting tidbit regarding Clinton’s attitude toward the privacy of her staff’s emails. “After losing to Mr. Obama in the protracted 2008 primary,” the Journal’s review says, Clinton “was convinced that she had lost because some staffers – she wasn’t sure who – had been disloyal. So she ‘instructed a trusted aide to access the campaign’s server and download the [email] messages sent and received by top staffers.’”\n\nNixonian Paranoia\n\nIn other words, Clinton – in some Nixonian fit of paranoia – violated the privacy of her senior advisers in her own mole hunt, a revelation that reflects on her own self-described “mistake” to funnel her emails as Secretary of State through a private server rather than a government one. As the Journal’s review puts it: “she didn’t want anyone reading her emails the way she was reading those of her 2008 staffers.”\n\nBut there is even a greater irony in this revelation because of the current complaint from Clinton and her die-hard supporters that Russia sabotaged her campaign by releasing emails via WikiLeaks from the DNC, which described how party leaders had torpedoed the campaign of Clinton’s rival for the nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and other emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta, revealing the contents of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks and some pay-to-play features of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nWikiLeaks has denied that it received the emails from Russia – and President Obama’s outgoing intelligence chiefs presented no real evidence to support the allegations – but the conspiracy theory of the Trump campaign somehow colluding with the Russians to sink Clinton has become a groupthink among many Democrats as well as the mainstream U.S. media.\n\nSo, rather than conducting a serious autopsy on how Clinton and the national Democratic Party kicked away a winnable election against the buffoonish Donald Trump, national Democrats have created a Zombie explanation for their failures, blaming their stunning defeat on the Russians.\n\nThis hysteria over Russia-gate has consumed the first several months of the Trump presidency – badgering the Trump administration into a more belligerent posture toward nuclear-armed Russia – but leaving little incentive for the Democrats to assess what they need to do to appeal to working-class voters who chose Trump’s empty-headed populism over Clinton’s cold-hearted calculations.\n\nThe current conventional wisdom among the mainstream media, many Democrats and even some progressives is that the only way to explain the victory by pussy-grabbing Trump is to complain about an intervention by the evil Russians. Maybe Maddow and the other Russia-did-it conspiracy theorists will now denounce Shattered as just one more example of “Russian disinformation.”\n\nThe Times’ View\n\nThe New York Times’ review by Michiko Kakutani also notes how Shattered details Clinton’s dysfunction, but the newspaper inserted a phrase about “Russian meddling,” presumably to avoid a head-exploding cognitive dissonance among its readers who have been inundated over the past four months by the Times’ obsession on Russia! Russia! Russia!\n\nHowever, the Times’ review still focuses on the book’s larger message: “In fact, the portrait of the Clinton campaign that emerges from these pages is that of a Titanic-like disaster: an epic fail made up of a series of perverse and often avoidable missteps by an out-of-touch candidate and her strife-ridden staff that turned ‘a winnable race’ into ‘another iceberg-seeking campaign ship.’\n\n“It’s the story of a wildly dysfunctional and ‘spirit-crushing’ campaign that embraced a flawed strategy (based on flawed data) and that failed, repeatedly, to correct course. A passive-aggressive campaign that neglected to act on warning flares sent up by Democratic operatives on the ground in crucial swing states, and that ignored the advice of the candidate’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, and other Democratic Party elders, who argued that the campaign needed to work harder to persuade undecided and ambivalent voters (like working-class whites and millennials), instead of focusing so insistently on turning out core supporters.”\n\nSo, perhaps this new book about how Hillary Clinton really lost Campaign 2016 will enable national Democrats to finally start charting a course correction before the party slams another Titanic-style campaign into another iceberg.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

(For earlier articles about the October Surprise mystery, go to “Archives” at the Home Page and click on “October Surprise X-Files.”)\n\nLost History of Iran’s 1981 Coup\n\nThe U.S. mainstream media avoids the word “coup” when a disfavored leader is ousted, but the silence around Iran’s 1981 coup also may have served Ronald Reagan’s political self-interest in keeping secret his own “coup,” as Mahmood Delkhasteh reflects.\n\nBush-41’s October Surprise Denials\n\n“Deny everything,” British traitor Kim Philby said, explaining how the powerful can bluff past their crimes, a truism known to George H.W. Bush when he denied charges of his own near treason in the October Surprise case, writes Robert Parry. April 6, 2016. For an exclusive interview of Robert Parry discussing this article, click here. April 8, 2016.\n\nWhen Israel/Neocons Favored Iran\n\nThe modern history of U.S.-Israeli-Iranian relations dates back 35 years to a time of political intrigue when Israel’s Likud leaders and the Reagan administration’s neocons secretly worked to arm Iran’s radical regime, an inconvenient truth given today’s anti-Iran hysteria, writes Robert Parry. July 28, 2015.\n\nFailing to Hide Israel-Iran-Iraq Secrets\n\nMany Americans think secret U.S. documents become public after, say, 30 years, but many are hidden indefinitely to conceal inconvenient truths that could enlighten public debate, as Robert Parry discovered in getting a redacted version of a “top secret” paper from 1981 that he had already found in unredacted form. May 11, 2015.\n\nSaddam’s Green Light\n\nAn article from the first investigative series published at Consortiumnews in early 1996 revealed top-secret “ talking points ” used by Secretary of State Haig in 1981 to brief President Reagan about the Middle East, including an alleged U.S. “green light” for Iraq to invade Iran. Journalist Robert Parry found the document in old congressional files. Republished May 11, 2015.\n\nThe US-Israel-Iran Triangle’s Tangled History\n\nIran and world powers have gone into double-overtime in negotiations to ensure that Iran doesn’t build a nuclear bomb, but the shadow over the talks is darkened by decades of distrust and double-dealing, a dimly understood history of the U.S.-Israeli-Iranian triangle, reports Robert Parry. April 2, 2015.\n\nLBJ’s ‘X’ File on Nixon’s ‘Treason’\n\nThe letter to Iran from 47 Republicans senators, seeking to kill President Obama’s talks on limiting Iran’s nuclear program, recalls other GOP sabotage of foreign policy by Democratic presidents, including Richard Nixon’s scheme to stop a Vietnam peace deal in 1968, as Robert Parry wrote in 2012. Republished March 13, 2015.\n\nBen Bradlee’s Not Such ‘A Good Life’ — Part 2\n\nIn recent years, the Washington Post’s emergence as a neocon propaganda sheet has struck some as a betrayal of the Post’s earlier reputation as a serious newspaper. But many of the paper’s current tendencies can be traced back to its iconic editor Ben Bradlee, writes James DiEugenio in Part 2 of this series. March 10, 2015.\n\nHow Roy Cohn Helped Rupert Murdoch\n\nThrough Fox News and a vast media empire, Rupert Murdoch wields enormous political clout in the United States, but his entrée into the world of Washington power came from the notorious McCarthyite Roy Cohn who opened the door into Ronald Reagan’s Oval Office, reports Robert Parry. January 28, 2015.\n\nThe Sorry Record of a Muslim-Basher\n\nJumping on the Muslim-bashing bandwagon, Fox News’ commentator Steven Emerson claimed Muslims have seized control of parts of London and all of Birmingham, terrorizing non-Muslims to flee, claims so absurd that even he was forced to back-track, reports Robert Parry. January 12, 2015.\n\nAn Insider’s View of Nixon’s ‘Treason’\n\nA recently released oral history by one of President Nixon’s secretive operatives sheds new light on perhaps Nixon’s darkest crime, the sabotaging of Vietnam peace talks so he could win the 1968 election, writes Robert Parry. July 5, 2014.\n\nReagan-Bush Ties to Iran-Hostage Crisis\n\nThe Senate wants to block Iran’s new UN ambassador because he was linked to the Iran hostage crisis 35 years ago, but that standard would strip honors from Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, implicated in extending the hostage crisis to win the 1980 election, reports Robert Parry. April 9, 2014.\n\nFirewall: Inside the Iran-Contra Cover-up\n\nThe death of Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh on Wednesday at the age of 102 marked the passing of what is now rare in the American Establishment, a person who courageously fought for a truthful historical record, as Robert Parry explained in this 1997 review of Walsh’s memoir, Firewall. March 21, 2014.\n\nThe Best and Worst US Presidents\n\nFrom the start of the Republic, some U.S. presidents favored government activism to address the nation’s problems, while others let the states do what they wanted and business tycoons have their way, a distinction that Robert Parry says can define the best and worst. February 18, 2014.\n\nA Blind Eye to LBJ’s ‘X-File’\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson’s legacy is in the news whether his many domestic achievements should outweigh his disastrous escalation of the Vietnam War but no attention is being paid to evidence that LBJ might have ended the war if not for Richard Nixon’s sabotage, writes Robert Parry. April 11, 2014\n\nReagan-Bush Ties to Iran-Hostage Crisis\n\nThe Senate wants to block Iran’s new UN ambassador because he was linked to the Iran hostage crisis 35 years ago, but that standard would strip honors from Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, implicated in extending the hostage crisis to win the 1980 election, reports Robert Parry. April 9, 2014\n\nRobert Strauss’s Watergate Secret\n\nRobert Strauss, who died Wednesday, was a Democratic powerbroker who thrived in the age of Nixon, Reagan and Bush-41. But an enduring Watergate mystery is whether Strauss earned his GOP spurs by secretly helping the Republicans in the spy scandal, reports Robert Parry. March 20, 2014\n\nDoes Nixon’s ‘Treason’ Boost LBJ’s Legacy?\n\nThe Vietnam War has doomed President Lyndon Johnson to a lowly status among presidents, overshadowing his domestic successes. But LBJ’s ranking might change if the new evidence on Richard Nixon sabotaging LBJ’s Vietnam peace talks were factored in, writes Robert Parry. February 16, 2014\n\nRobert Gates Double-Crosses Obama\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Robert Gates is slamming President Obama in a new memoir, accusing him of lacking enthusiasm for the Afghan War. But perhaps Obama’s bigger mistake was trusting Gates, a Bush Family operative with a history of dirty dealing, writes Robert Parry. January 8, 2014\n\nJudge Leon’s Dirty Climb to the Bench\n\nCivil libertarians are cheering federal judge Richard Leon for his ruling against the NSA’s massive surveillance program and that’s all to the good but Leon’s route to the bench followed a twisted course of partisan investigations and one historic cover-up, Robert Parry reports. December 17, 2013\n\nAlmost Thwarting Nixon’s Dirtiest Trick\n\nIn 1968, the public anger over the Vietnam War tempted GOP presidential nominee Richard Nixon to sabotage Democratic peace talks to seal his victory, a dirty trick that Saigon-based journalist Beverly Deepe nearly exposed before American voters went to the polls. November 22, 2013\n\nDangerous Addiction to Secrecy\n\nAfter decades of mutual suspicions, the U.S. and Iranian governments appear headed toward face-to-face contacts. But mutual trust still awaits truth-telling about important facts that defined the relationship — and that may require breaking a dangerous addiction to secrecy, says Robert Parry. September 24, 2013.\n\nA CIA Hand in an American ‘Coup’?\n\nThe U.S. government decries leaks, but the other side of the story is that key chapters of American history are hidden from the public for decades and maybe forever. The CIA has just admitted its 1953 Iran coup and may never acknowledge a role in ousting Jimmy Carter in 1980, Robert Parry reports. August 26, 2013\n\nScooping ‘the Boys’ of Vietnam Press\n\nDuring her seven years covering the Vietnam War, Beverly Deepe Keever broke through the male-dominated world of war reporting and nearly changed history with her discovery that Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign was sabotaging the Paris peace talks, notes Don North in his review of her memoir. July 30, 2013.\n\nCables Hold Clues to US-Iran Mysteries\n\nIran’s election of Hassan Rowhani as president has raised hopes for a deal, with Iran accepting tighter constraints on its nuclear program and the West rolling back sanctions. But there has been a long and often secret history of double-dealing between Iran and the U.S., Robert Parry reported in 2010. Republished June 21, 2013.\n\nSecond Thoughts on October Surprise\n\nNew evidence has shaken the confidence of former Rep. Lee Hamilton in his two-decade-old judgment clearing Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign of going behind President Carter’s back to frustrate his efforts to free 52 U.S. hostages in Iran, the so-called October Surprise case, Robert Parry reports. June 8, 2013\n\nWhat a Real Cover-up Looks Like\n\nRepublicans won’t let go of their conspiracy theory about some nefarious “cover-up” in “talking points” for Ambassador Susan Rice’s TV interviews on the Benghazi attack. But they should at least have better skills for detecting a real cover-up, since they’ve had direct experience, as Robert Parry documents. May 21, 2013\n\nDoes Woodward Know Watergate?\n\nRepublicans are hyping the flap over Benghazi talking points by calling it “worse than Watergate,” a false narrative that Bob Woodward has helped along by ignoring new evidence connecting Richard Nixon’s sabotage of Vietnam War peace talks in 1968 to his political spying in 1971-72, writes Robert Parry. May 20, 2013\n\nThe Right’s ‘Scandal’ Funhouse Mirror\n\nOfficial Washington is captivated by the image of Obama “scandals,” including Benghazi talking points and extra IRS questions posed to Tea Party groups, but journalists are peering into the Right’s funhouse mirror which for decades has made big scandals small and small scandals big, says Robert Parry. May 14, 2013.\n\nRepublican Hypocrisy on Benghazi\n\nOfficial Washington is obsessing over the Benghazi “scandal,” proof that the Republicans and their right-wing media can make the smallest things big and the biggest things small. It is a disparity that has distorted how Americans understand their recent history, writes Robert Parry. May 10, 2013.\n\nAnother Ignored Russian Warning\n\nOne year after the Cold War ended, Russia tried to cooperate with a U.S. national security investigation into possible treason by senior American officials only to see the information ignored. Two decades later, Russians feel their warning about a Boston Marathon bomber was ignored again, Robert Parry reports. April 23, 2013.\n\nWhat Happened to the US Press Corps?\n\nAs the U.S. observes the tenth anniversary of the Iraq invasion, a key question remains: Why was there almost no accountability for journalists and pundits who went along with George W. Bush’s deceptions. The answer can be found in the cover-ups of the Reagan-Bush-41 era, writes Robert Parry. March 18, 2013\n\nThe GOP Knows Power\n\nToday’s Republican Party doesn’t believe in democracy, at least not when an election is decided by the votes of blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and young urban whites comfortable with multiculturalism. Then, the outcome is deemed illegitimate and deserves obstruction, as Robert Parry explains. March 14, 2013\n\nRethinking Watergate/Iran-Contra\n\nNew evidence continues to accumulate showing how Official Washington got key elements of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals wrong, especially how these two crimes of state originated in treacherous actions to secure the powers of the presidency, writes Robert Parry. March 9, 2013\n\n‘October Surprise’ and ‘Argo’\n\nIran’s ex-President Bani-Sadr, in criticizing inaccurate history in “Argo,” says most Iranian officials wanted a quick end to the 1980 U.S.-Iranian hostage crisis, but Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign struck a deal with Ayatollah Khomeini to delay the hostages’ release, reports Robert Parry. March 7, 2013\n\nThe Short-Sighted History of ‘Argo’\n\nThe Oscar for Best Picture went to Ben Affleck’s Argo, an escape-thriller set in post-revolutionary Iran. It hyped the drama and edged into propaganda. But Americans would have learned a lot more if Affleck had chosen the CIA coup in 1953 or the Republican chicanery in 1980, says Robert Parry. February 25, 2013\n\nWaking Up to Iran’s Real History\n\nAn Oscar frontrunner for best picture is “Argo,” depicting a little-known chapter of the U.S-Iran hostage standoff in 1979-81. Yet, while focusing on this story of six hostages escaping, “Argo” missed bigger dramas, before and after, as David Swanson explained. January 11, 2013\n\nThe L’Enfant Plaza Hotel Mystery\n\nTo understand why U.S. foreign policy is floundering in the Middle East, one must go back to the pivotal 1980 election when President Carter’s hopes for a second term hinged on getting Iran to release 52 U.S. hostages and Republicans went behind his back, writes Robert Parry. February 17, 2013\n\nHow Neocons Messed Up the Mideast\n\nNewly available documents reveal how Ronald Reagan’s neocon aides cleared the way for Israeli arms sales to Iran in 1981, shortly after Iran freed 52 U.S. hostages whose captivity doomed Jimmy Carter’s reelection. The move also planted the seeds of the Iran-Contra scandal, reports Robert Parry. February 15, 2013\n\nRichard Nixon’s Even-Darker Legacy\n\nRichard Nixon, who was born a century ago, cast a long shadow over U.S. politics, arguably reaching to the anything-goes tactics of today’s Republican Party. His admirers want to reverse history’s negative judgment but perhaps the Nixon centennial can finally allow for recognition of Nixon’s dirtiest trick, says Robert Parry. February 2, 2013\n\nAmerica’s War for Reality\n\nThe United States has been on a three-decade binge of unreality, imbibing delusions that began with Ronald Reagan and have continued through the Tea Party. The challenge now is for rational Americans to show they have the toughness and tenacity to fight for the real world — and to save it, writes Robert Parry. January 15, 2013\n\nAmerica’s Bloody Price for Power\n\n“The Untold History of the United States” shakes up the traditional recounting of the last century, forcing Americans to rethink key assumptions, but director Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick have not written a people’s history, says Jim DiEugenio in part two of his review.\n\nWho Bombed Ben-Menashe’s House?\n\nMontreal police may hope to just nail the “torch,” the culprit who hurled a fire-bomb into the home of ex-Israeli spy Ari Ben-Menashe. But to solve the mystery, they may have to delve into Ben-Menashe’s complex intelligence ties, including his hostile relations with his old superiors in Israel, writes Robert Parry. December 8, 2012\n\nBen-Menashe Case Eyes Bomb Residue\n\nThe investigation of the firebombing of the upscale Montreal home of ex-Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe is looking at the possibility the accelerant was more sophisticated than available to common criminals, reports Robert Parry. December 5, 2012\n\nArson Seen in Attack on Ex-Israeli Spy\n\nSuspected arson destroyed the Montreal home of ex-Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe, who says he escaped through a rear door. It’s unclear if the fire was an assassination attempt to finally silence a man who has angered the Israeli government, powerful Republicans and others, writes Robert Parry. December 3, 2012\n\nHow Israel Out-Foxed US Presidents\n\nJust days after President Obama’s reelection, Israel launched a punishing bombing campaign against Palestinians in Gaza much as Israel did shortly after his election in 2008. Obama again is put in a tight spot, but other U.S. presidents faced similar challenges, as Morgan Strong reported in 2010. Republished November 19, 2012\n\nThe Death Toll of Watergate\n\nMajor gaps in the history of Watergate and Iran-Contra have let Republicans minimize those scandals by comparing them to the fabricated “scandal” over the Benghazi attacks. A fuller understanding of Watergate would reveal its links to Richard Nixon’s prolonging the Vietnam War, writes Robert Parry. November 17, 2012\n\nThe Price of Political Purity\n\nWar with Iran is on the Nov. 6 ballot with President Obama on the verge of a peace deal and Mitt Romney favoring confrontation. The choice is like 1968 when many on the Left distrusted President Johnson’s Vietnam peace promises and enabled Richard Nixon to extend the war four years, Robert Parry noted last June. Republished October 29, 2012\n\nThe October Surprise Mysteries\n\nWith hopes brightening that President Obama is close to a negotiated settlement of the Iran nuclear dispute, Mitt Romney’s campaign is eager to counter any positive news. The moment is reminiscent of past October Surprise moments, says Robert Parry in this article adapted from America’s Stolen Narrative. October 22, 2012\n\nAn Israeli October Surprise for Obama?\n\nA pressing foreign policy question of the U.S. presidential race is whether Israel might exploit this politically delicate time to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites and force President Obama to join the attack or face defeat at the polls, a predicament with similarities to one President Carter faced in 1980, writes Robert Parry. August 18, 2012\n\nBohemian Grove & Reagan’s ‘Treason’\n\nThis weekend, Occupy protesters are targeting the Bohemian Grove in California, where well-connected rich men go on retreats several weekends each summer. The secrecy of the 1980 encampment became a factor in the cover-up of possible “treason” by Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, writes Robert Parry. July 13, 2012\n\nShamir’s October Surprise Admission\n\nTwo decades ago, ex-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir offered the stunning confirmation that “of course” an October Surprise plot had blocked President Jimmy Carter from gaining the release of 52 U.S. hostages in Iran, thus helping Ronald Reagan win the presidency in 1980, reports Robert Parry. July 3, 2012\n\nAdmissions on Nixon’s ‘Treason’\n\nDefinitive proof of a historical mystery is often elusive, even with archival documents and memoirs. Skeptics can always say some witness or some evidence isn’t perfect. But the case that Richard Nixon sabotaged the Vietnam peace talks in 1968 to win that pivotal election is clear, writes Robert Parry. June 14, 2012\n\nThe Dark Continuum of Watergate\n\nThe 40th anniversary of the Watergate break-in has brought reflections on the scandal’s larger meaning, but Official Washington still misses the connection to perhaps Richard Nixon’s dirtiest trick, the torpedoing of Vietnam peace talks that could have ended the war four years earlier, Robert Parry reports. June 12, 2012\n\nThe Almost Scoop on Nixon’s ‘Treason’\n\nAt the end of Campaign 1968, as Richard Nixon feared his narrow lead could disappear if progress were made on Vietnam peace, a U.S. correspondent in Saigon got wind of a cabal between Nixon and South Vietnamese leaders to block peace talks and secure his victory. History was at a crossroads, writes Robert Parry. June 7, 2012\n\nObama Gets Tough, Finally\n\nPresident Obama looks ready for a political fight, telling his supporters “Let’s go get ‘em. It’s game time.” But is the U.S. political/media system ready for a Democrat turning the tables on the Republicans in terms of toughness after decades of Republicans playing the bullies asks Robert Parry. May 7, 2012\n\nHow the Right’s Smear Machine Started\n\nThe Right’s attack machine, which these days questions President Obama’s birthplace and smears Georgetown student Sandra Fluke over contraceptives, arose in the wake of the Vietnam War and Watergate with young conservatives thinking they were the real victims, thus justifying whatever they did, reports Robert Parry. March 8, 2012\n\nAn Israeli October Surprise on Obama?\n\nPresident Obama is walking a political tightrope between constraining Iran’s nuclear program and restraining Israel’s war threats, while political critics are shaking the supports. But ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar says Obama’s predicament may be even trickier, with Israeli hardliners possibly eyeing an October surprise. March 7, 2012\n\nRomney’s Made-up History on Iran\n\nIn facing down Iran as U.S. president, Mitt Romney says he would be guided by the experience of Ronald Reagan threatening Iran with a military strike if it didn’t free 52 Americans held hostage during Jimmy Carter’s presidency. But Romney’s historical precedent is a fantasy, writes Robert Parry. March 6, 2012\n\nProfiting Off Nixon’s Vietnam ‘Treason’\n\nThe notion of Wall Street bankers meeting in private to discuss profiting off a plot to extend the Vietnam War and risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers may sound like a conspiracy movie script, but it is a tragic reality reflected in once secret White House documents, reports Robert Parry. March 4, 2012\n\nLBJ’s ‘X’ File on Nixon’s ‘Treason’\n\nIn the dusty files of Lyndon Johnson’s presidential library in Austin, Texas, once secret documents and audiotapes tell a dark and tragic story of how Richard Nixon’s team secured the White House in 1968 by sabotaging peace talks that might have ended the Vietnam War four years earlier, Robert Parry reports. March 3, 2012\n\nThe Almost Vanunu\n\nTwo decades ago, the U.S. and Israeli governments reached around the world to silence an ex-Israeli intelligence officer who was exposing sensitive secrets. The goal was to discredit, if not capture, Ari Ben-Menashe much the way Israel went after nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu, reports Marshall Wilson. February 1, 2012\n\nGetting Rid of ‘Anti-Israel’ Presidents\n\nSome staunch supporters of Israel believe that its interests are so compelling that they trump American self-governance, with one extremist suggesting the murder of President Obama. Others, however, appear to have joined in an earlier subversion of U.S. democracy, Robert Parry reports. January 21, 2012\n\nHerding American’s to War with Iran\n\nThe murder of a fifth Iranian scientist on the streets of Tehran had all the earmarks of an Israeli-sponsored assassination. The killing also worsened tensions at a moment when the momentum toward war with Iran seems unstoppable, reports Robert Parry. January 12, 2012\n\nRepublican Tradition of Hostage-Taking\n\nSince the days of Richard Nixon, Republicans have pursued an anything-goes brand of politics that often has the look of hostage-taking, with Democrats usually caving in. But, Robert Parry asks, has President Obama finally learned that the only way to stop bullying is to stand up to it? December 23, 2011\n\nThe Lost Opportunity of Iran-Contra\n\nA quarter century ago with the breaking of the Iran-Contra scandal, the United States had a chance to step back from its march toward Empire and to demand accountability for White House crimes. But instead a powerful cover-up prevailed, reports Robert Parry. December 1, 2011\n\nWho is Judge Richard Leon?\n\nThe appointment of federal judges is a key power of the U.S. president. It can reward partisan allies for past services and ensure favorable rulings in the future. Both factors were in play for District Judge Richard Leon who just struck down new cigarette warnings, writes Robert Parry. November 9, 2011\n\nThe GOP’s History of ‘Hostage-Taking’\n\nFor more than four decades, Democrats have tolerated Republican abuses, claiming accountability wouldn’t be “good for the country.” But this softness has only encouraged the kind of hardball behavior that has now taken the U.S. economy “hostage,” writes Robert Parry. November 6, 2011\n\nUnmasking October Surprise Debunker\n\nThe fake “debunking” of the 1980 October Surprise case in the early 1990s was driven by a few “journalists,” including Steven Emerson, who has been identified in a recent report as a “misinformation expert” spreading anti-Muslim propaganda, reports Robert Parry. October 30, 2011\n\nTaking a Bush Secret to the Grave\n\nThe National Archives has approved an appeal by journalist Robert Parry seeking release of a 30-year-old secret, the address where George H.W. Bush supposedly went on an October weekend in 1980, when several witnesses put Bush in Paris meeting with Iranians. But it turns out the “alibi witness” is now dead. September 27, 2011\n\nBush’s October Surprise File in Dispute\n\nThe enduring October Surprise mystery whether Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign sabotaged President Jimmy Carter’s efforts to free 52 American hostages in Iran has reached a possible turning point, whether details of George H.W. Bush’s activities on a key day will be released, reports Robert Parry. September 9, 2011\n\nKeeping a Curious Bush Secret\n\nOne of the strange mysteries from the Reagan-Bush era is where did George H.W. Bush go on one Sunday in October 1980 when some witnesses placed him meeting with Iranians in Paris. More than three decades later, Bush’s supposed alibi remains a state secret, Robert Parry reports. August 12, 2011\n\nOctober Surprise Evidence Surfaces\n\nAmong newly released archival records is the first U.S. documentary evidence that William Casey took a trip to Madrid possibly related to the 1980 October Surprise conspiracy. Doubts that Ronald Reagan’s campaign chief went to Madrid fueled a media frenzy in 1991 to debunk allegations of a secret GOP deal with Iran, says Robert Parry. July 14, 2011\n\nInside the October Surprise Cover-up\n\nThe George H.W. Bush Library in Texas has just released thousands of pages of documents on the October Surprise mystery, revealing how Bush’s inner circle handled allegations that the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 struck a treacherous deal with Iran. It was a textbook case of controlling the narrative, reports Robert Parry. July 12, 2011\n\nBachmann’s Aide Hides $10M Secret\n\nWhen Rep. Michelle Bachmann landed Ed Rollins as her campaign manager, the move gave a shot of credibility to her presidential bid. Washington pundits adore Rollins and his blunt style, so much so that they have ignored the fact that he is still covering up an illegal $10 million suitcase full of cash from Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Robert Parry reports. July 10, 2011\n\nBob Gates’s ‘Business’ of Lying\n\nAs Defense Secretary Robert Gates prepares to retire in late June, he is routinely lauded as a “wise man” committed to telling it like it is, even making a frank comment this week about how “most governments lie to each other.” But Gates’s own record for honesty is a deeply checkered one, reports Robert Parry. June 17, 2011\n\nNetanyahu Sets Limits for Obama\n\nPresident Barack Obama got an Oval Office lecture from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how far Obama may deviate from Israel’s positions on Mideast peace. This public rebuke raises questions about whether Netanyahu will now try to sink Obama’s reelection the way earlier Likud leaders undermined President Jimmy Carter, reports Robert Parry. May 21, 2011\n\nJimmy Carter’s October Surprise Doubts\n\nEx-President Jimmy Carter tells an interviewer that he isn’t sure what to believe about the longstanding suspicions that Republicans went behind his back in 1980 to stop him from freeing 52 American hostages in Iran, a failure that contributed to his political demise. But Robert Parry reports that there is a wealth of historical evidence. May 12, 2011\n\nTwenty Years Ago, a Lost Opportunity\n\nTwo decades ago, the U.S. political/media system had a chance to get Ronald Reagan’s history right, but didn’t, says Robert Parry. April 15, 2011\n\nDon’t Try These GOP Alibis at Home\n\nWhen powerful Republicans are in a pinch, they can use crazy alibis that would make anyone else look guiltier, says Robert Parry. August 12, 2010\n\nOctober Surprise Cover-up Unravels\n\nDie-hard defenders of the October Surprise (1980) cover-up keep citing alibis that have long ago disintegrated, says Robert Parry. August 6, 2010\n\nAccusation of October Surprise ‘Lying’\n\nAttorney Lawrence Barcella accuses journalist Robert Parry of “lying” about the October Surprise case, and Parry responds. August 5, 2010\n\nRethinking Iran-Contra\n\nThe recent collapse of the long-running October Surprise cover-up shifts the history on the Iran-Contra scandal, writes Robert Parry. July 1, 2010\n\nThe CIA/Likud Sinking of Jimmy Carter\n\nWith the October Surprise cover-up in shambles, the evidence points to a CIA-Likud plot against President Carter, says Robert Parry. June 24, 2010\n\nThe Tricky October Surprise Report\n\nA House task force deceived the American public in clearing Ronald Reagan of a treacherous scheme with Iran, reports Robert Parry. June 17, 2010\n\nKey October Surprise Evidence Hidden\n\nA Russian report on the 1980 October Surprise case was apparently kept from the chief congressional investigator, says Robert Parry. May 6, 2010\n\nThe October Surprise Crystal Balls\n\nA sub-plot of the 1980 October Surprise mystery is how some Reaganites foresaw the U.S. hostage release, says Robert Parry. November 13, 2009\n\nThe Crazy October Surprise Debunking\n\nTo protect the Reagan-Bush-I legacy, Republicans and Democrats created absurd October Surprise alibis, reports Robert Parry. November 6, 2009\n\nHow Two Elections Changed America\n\nSecret Republican operations around elections in 1968 and 1980 set the U.S. on today’s troubled course, says Robert Parry.

On April 6, Trump fired off 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airbase; he also restored the neocon demand for “regime change” in Syria; and he alleged that Russia was possibly complicit in the supposed chemical attack.\n\nSince Trump took those actions – in accordance with the neocon desires for more “regime change” in the Middle East and a costly New Cold War with Russia – Russia-gate has almost vanished from the news.\n\nI did find a little story in the lower right-hand corner of page A12 of Saturday’s New York Times about a still-eager Democratic congressman, Mike Quigley of Illinois, who spent a couple of days in Cyprus which attracted his interest because it is a known site for Russian money-laundering, but he seemed to leave more baffled than when he arrived.\n\n“The more I learn, the more complex, layered and textured I see the Russia issue is – and that reinforces the need for professional full-time investigators,” Quigley said, suggesting that the investigation’s failure to strike oil is not that the holes are dry but that he needs better drill bits.\n\nYet, given all the hype and hullabaloo over Russia-gate, the folks who were led to believe that the vague and amorphous allegations were “bigger than Watergate” might now be feeling a little used. It appears they may have been sucked into a conspiracy frenzy in which the Establishment exploited their enthusiasm over the “scandal” in a clever maneuver to bludgeon an out-of-step new President back into line.\n\nIf that’s indeed the case, perhaps the most significant success of the Russia-gate ploy was the ouster of Trump’s original National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen as a key proponent of a New Détente with Russia, and his replacement by General H.R. McMaster, a protégé of neocon favorite, retired Gen. David Petraeus.\n\nMcMaster was viewed as the key player in arranging the April 6 missile strike on Syria and in preparing a questionable “intelligence assessment” on April 11 to justify the rush to judgment. Although McMaster’s four-page white paper has been accepted as gospel by the mainstream U.S. news media, its many weaknesses have been noted by actual experts, such as MIT national security and technology professor Theodore Postol.\n\nHow Washington Works\n\nBut the way Official Washington works is that Trump was made to look weak when he argued for a more cooperative and peaceful relationship with Russia. Hillary Clinton dubbed him Vladimir Putin’s “puppet” and “Saturday Night Live” portrayed Trump as in thrall to a bare-chested Putin. More significantly, front-page stories every morning and cable news segments every night created the impression of a compromised U.S. President in Putin’s pocket.\n\nConversely, Trump was made to look strong when he fired off missiles against a Syrian airbase and talked tough about Russian guilt. Neocon commentator Charles Krauthammer praised Trump’s shift as demonstrating that “America is back.”\n\nTrump further enhanced his image for toughness when his military dropped the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB), nicknamed the “mother of all bombs,” on some caves in Afghanistan. While the number of casualties inflicted by the blast was unclear, Trump benefited from the admiring TV and op-ed commentaries about him finally acting “presidential.”\n\nBut the real test of political courage is to go against the grain in a way that may be unpopular in the short term but is in the best interests of the United States and the world community in the longer term.\n\nIn that sense, Trump seeking peaceful cooperation with Russia – even amid the intense anti-Russian propaganda of the past several years – required actual courage, while launching missiles and dropping bombs might win praise but actually make the U.S. position in the world weaker.\n\nTrump, however, saw his fledgling presidency crumbling under the daily barrage of Russia-gate, even though there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the U.S. election and there wasn’t even clear evidence that Russia was behind the disclosure of Democratic emails, via WikiLeaks, during the campaign.\n\nStill, the combined assault from the Democrats, the neocons and the mainstream media forced Trump to surrender his campaign goal of achieving a more positive relationship with Russia and greater big-power collaboration in the fight against terrorism.\n\nFor Trump, the incessant chatter about Russia-gate was like a dripping water torture. The thin-skinned Trump fumed at his staff and twittered messages aimed at changing the narrative, such as accusing President Obama of “wiretapping” Trump Tower. But nothing worked.\n\nHowever, once Trump waved the white flag by placing his foreign policy under the preferred banner of the neoconservatives, the Russia-gate pressure stopped. The op-ed pages suddenly were hailing his “decisiveness.” If you were a neocon, you might say about Russia-gate: Mission accomplished!\n\nRussia-gate’s Achievements\n\nBesides whipping Trump into becoming a more compliant politician, Russia-gate could claim some other notable achievements. For instance, it spared the national Democrats from having to confront their own failures in Campaign 2016 by diverting responsibility for the calamity of Trump’s election.\n\nInstead of Democratic leaders taking responsibility for picking a dreadful candidate, ignoring the nation’s anti-establishment mood, and failing to offer any kind of inspiring message, the national Democrats could palm off the blame on “Russia! Russia! Russia!”\n\nThus, rather than looking in the mirror and trying to figure out how to correct their deep-seated problems, the national Democrats could instead focus on a quixotic tilting at Trump’s impeachment.\n\nMany on the Left joined in this fantasy because they have been so long without a Movement that the huge post-inaugural “pussy hat” marches were a temptation that they couldn’t resist. Russia-gate became the fuel to keep the “Movement” bandwagon rolling. #Resistance!\n\nIt didn’t matter that the “scandal” – the belief that Russia somehow conspired with Trump to rig the U.S. presidential election – amounted to a bunch of informational dots that didn’t connect.\n\nRussia-gate also taught the American “left” to learn to love McCarthyism since “proof” of guilt pretty much amounted to having had contact with a Russian — and anyone who questioned the dubious factual basis of the “scandal” was dismissed as a “Russian propagandist” or a “Moscow stooge” or a purveyor of “fake news.”\n\nAnother Russia-gate winner was the mainstream news media which got a lot of mileage – and loads of new subscription money – by pushing the convoluted conspiracy. The New York Times positioned itself as the great protector of “truth” and The Washington Post adopted a melodramatic new slogan: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.”\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, the Post ran a front-page article touting an anonymous Internet group called PropOrNot that identified some 200 Internet news sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other major sources of independent journalism, as guilty of “Russian propaganda.” Facts weren’t needed; the accused had no chance for rebuttal; the accusers even got to hide in the shadows; the smear was the thing.\n\nThe Post and the Times also conflated news outlets that dared to express skepticism toward claims from the U.S. State Department with some entrepreneurial sites that trafficked in intentionally made-up stories or “fake news” to make money.\n\nTo the Post and Times, there appeared to be no difference between questioning the official U.S. narrative on, say, the Ukraine crisis and knowingly fabricating pretend news articles to get lots of clicks. Behind the smokescreen of Russia-gate, the mainstream U.S. news media took the position that there was only one side to a story, what Official Washington chose to believe.\n\nWhile it’s likely that there will be some revival of Russia-gate to avoid the appearance of a completely manufactured scandal, the conspiracy theory’s more significant near-term consequence could be that it has taught Donald Trump a dangerous lesson.\n\nIf he finds himself in a tight spot, the way out is to start bombing some “enemy” halfway around the world. The next time, however, the target might not be so willing to turn the other cheek. If, say, Trump launches a preemptive strike against North Korea, the result could be a retaliatory nuclear attack against South Korea or Japan.\n\nOr, if the neocons push ahead with their ultimate “regime change” strategy of staging a “color revolution” in Moscow to overthrow Putin, the outcome might be – not the pliable new leader that the neocons would want – but an unstable Russian nationalist who might see a nuclear attack on the U.S. as the only way to protect the honor of Mother Russia.\n\nFor all his faults, Trump did offer a more temperate approach toward U.S.-Russian relations, which also could have tamped down spending for nuclear and other strategic weapons and freed up some of that money for infrastructure and other needs at home. But that was before Russia-gate.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Indeed, part of the professional challenge of journalism was to sort out conflicting facts on a complicated topic. Often we found that the initial impression of a story was wrong once we understood the more nuanced reality.\n\nToday, however, particularly on foreign policy issues, the major U.S. news outlets, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, apparently believe there is only one side to a story, the one espoused by the U.S. government or more generically the Establishment.\n\nAny other interpretation of a set of facts gets dismissed as “fringe” or “fake news” even if there are obvious holes in the official story and a lack of verifiable proof to support the mainstream groupthink. Very quickly, alternative explanations are cast aside while ridicule is heaped on those who disagree.\n\nSo, for instance, The New York Times will no longer allow any doubt to creep in about its certainty that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad intentionally dropped a sarin bomb on the remote rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province in northern Syria on April 4.\n\nA mocking article by the Times’ Jim Rutenberg on Monday displayed the Times’ rejection of any intellectual curiosity regarding the U.S. government’s claims that were cited by President Trump as justification for his April 6 missile strike against a Syrian military airbase. The attack killed several soldiers and nine civilians including four children, according to Syrian press reports.\n\nRutenberg traveled to Moscow with the clear intention of mocking the Russian news media for its “fake news” in contrast to The New York Times, which holds itself out as the world’s premier guardian of “the truth.” Rather than deal with the difficulty of assessing what happened in Khan Sheikhoun, which is controlled by Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate and where information therefore should be regarded as highly suspect, Rutenberg simply assessed that the conventional wisdom in the West must be correct.\n\nTo discredit any doubters, Rutenberg associated them with one of the wackier conspiracy theories of radio personality Alex Jones, another version of the Times’ recent troubling reliance on McCarthyistic logical fallacies, not only applying guilt by association but refuting reasonable skepticism by tying it to someone who in an entirely different context expressed unreasonable skepticism.\n\nRutenberg wrote: “As soon as I turned on a television here I wondered if I had arrived through an alt-right wormhole. Back in the States, the prevailing notion in the news was that Mr. Assad had indeed been responsible for the chemical strike. There was some ‘reportage’ from sources like the conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones — best known for suggesting that the Sandy Hook school massacre was staged — that the chemical attack was a ‘false flag’ operation by terrorist rebel groups to goad the United States into attacking Mr. Assad. But that was a view from the [U.S.] fringe. Here in Russia, it was the dominant theme throughout the overwhelmingly state-controlled mainstream media.”\n\nErgo, in Rutenberg’s sophistry, the “prevailing notion in the [U.S.] news” must be accepted as true, regardless of the checkered history of such confidence in the past, i.e., the “prevailing notion” that Saddam Hussein was hiding WMD in Iraq in 2003. Today, to shut down any serious evaluation of the latest WMD claims about Syria just say: “Alex Jones.”\n\nThus, any evidence that the April 4 incident might have been staged or might have resulted from an accidental release of Al Qaeda-controlled chemicals must be dismissed as something on par with believing the wildest of silly conspiracy theories. (Indeed, one of the reasons that I detest conspiracy theories is that they often reject hard evidence in favor of fanciful speculation, which then can be used, in exactly the way that Rutenberg did, to undermine serious efforts to sort through conflicting accounts and questionable evidence in other cases.)\n\nAlternative Explanations\n\nIn the case of the April 4 incident, there were several alternative explanations that deserved serious attention, including the possibility that Al Qaeda had staged the event, possibly sacrificing innocent civilians in an attempt to trick President Trump into reversing his administration’s recent renunciation of the U.S. goal of “regime change” in Syria.\n\nThis notion is not as nutty as Rutenberg pretends. For instance, United Nations investigators received testimonies from Syrian eyewitnesses regarding another attempt by Al Qaeda-affiliated jihadists and their “rescue” teams to stage a chlorine attack in the town of Al-Tamanah on the night of April 29-30, 2014, and then spread word of the bogus attack through social media.\n\n“Seven witnesses stated that frequent alerts [about an imminent chlorine weapons attack by the government] had been issued, but in fact no incidents with chemicals took place,” the U.N. report stated. “While people sought safety after the warnings, their homes were looted and rumours spread that the events were being staged. … [T]hey [these witnesses] had come forward to contest the wide-spread false media reports.”\n\nThe rebels and their allies also made preposterous claims about how they knew canisters of chlorine were contained in “barrel bombs,” by citing the supposedly distinctive sound such chlorine-infused bombs made.\n\nThe U.N. report said, “The [rebel-connected] eyewitness, who stated to have been on the roof, said to have heard a helicopter and the ‘very loud’ sound of a falling barrel. Some interviewees had referred to a distinct whistling sound of barrels that contain chlorine as they fall. The witness statement could not be corroborated with any further information.”\n\nOf course, the statement could not be corroborated because it was crazy to believe that people could discern the presence of a chlorine canister inside a “barrel bomb” by its “distinct whistling sound.”\n\nStill, the U.N. team demanded that the Syrian government provide flight records to support its denial that any of its aircraft were in the air in that vicinity at the time of the attack. The failure of the Syrian government to provide those records of flights that it said did not happen was then cited by the U.N. investigators as somehow evidence of Syrian guilt, another challenge to rationality, since it would be impossible to produce flight records for flights that didn’t happen.\n\nDespite this evidence of a rebel fabrication – and the lack of a Syrian military purpose from using chlorine since it almost never kills anyone – the U.N. investigators succumbed to intense career pressure from the Western powers and accepted as true two other unverified rebel claims of chlorine attacks, leading the Western media to report as flat-fact that the Syrian government used chlorine bombs on civilians.\n\nThe Dubious Sarin Case\n\nBesides the dubious chlorine cases – and the evidence of at least one attempted fabrication – there was the infamous sarin attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, 2013, when there was a similar rush to judgment blaming the Syrian government although later evidence, including the maximum range of the sarin-carrying missile, pointed to the more likely guilt of Al Qaeda-connected extremists sacrificing the lives of civilians to advance their jihadist cause.\n\nIn all these cases, the Times and other Western news outlets behaved as if there was only one acceptable side to the story, the one that the U.S. government was pushing, i.e., blaming the Syrian government. It didn’t matter how implausible the claims were or how unreliable the sources.\n\nIn both the Aug. 21, 2013 sarin case and the current April 4, 2017 case, Western officials and media ignored the obvious motives for Al Qaeda to carry out a provocation, foist blame on the government and induce the U.S. to intervene on Al Qaeda’s side.\n\nIn August 2013, the Syrian government had just welcomed U.N. investigators who came to Damascus to investigate government allegations of rebels using chemical weapons against government troops. That the Syrian government would then conduct a poison-gas attack within miles of the hotel where the U.N. investigators were staying and thus divert their attention made no logical sense.\n\nSimilarly, in April 2017, the Syrian government was not only prevailing on the battlefield but had just received word that the Trump administration had reversed the U.S. policy demanding “regime change” in Damascus. So, the obvious motive to release chemical weapons was with Al Qaeda and its allies, not with the Syrian government.\n\nManufacturing a Motive\n\nThe West has struggled to explain why President Assad would pick that time – and a town of little military value – to drop a sarin bomb. The Times and other mainstream media have suggested that the answer lies in the barbarism and irrationality of Arabs. In that vaguely racist thinking, Assad was flaunting his impunity by dropping sarin in a victory celebration of sorts, even though the predicable consequence was a U.S. missile attack and Trump reversing again the U.S. policy to demand Assad’s ouster.\n\nOn April 11, five days after Trump’s decision to attack the Syrian airbase, Trump’s White House released a four-page “intelligence assessment” that offered another alleged motivation, Khan Sheikhoun’s supposed value as a staging area for a rebel offensive threatening government infrastructure. But that offensive had already been beaten back and the town was far from the frontlines.\n\nIn other words, there was no coherent motive for Assad to have dropped sarin on this remote town. There was, however, a very logical reason for Al Qaeda’s jihadists to stage a chemical attack and thus bring pressure on Assad’s government. (There’s also the possibility of an accidental release via a conventional government bombing of a rebel warehouse or from the rebels mishandling a chemical weapon – although some of the photographic evidence points more toward a staged event.)\n\nBut we’re not supposed to ask these questions – or doubt the “evidence” provided by Al Qaeda and its allies – because Alex Jones raised similar questions and Russian news outlets are reporting on this scenario, too.\n\nThere’s the additional problem with Rutenberg’s sophistry: Many of the April 4 sarin claims have been debunked by MIT national security and technology expert Theodore Postol, who has issued a series of reports shredding the claims from the White House’s “intelligence assessment.”\n\nFor instance, Postol cited the key photographs showing a supposed sarin canister crumpled inside a crater in a roadway. Postol noted that the canister appeared to be crushed, not exploded, and that the men in the photos inspecting the hole were not wearing protective gear that would have been required if there actually were sarin in the crater.\n\nAll of these anomalies and the problems with “evidence” generated by Al Qaeda and its allies should put the entire meme of the Syrian government using chemical weapons in doubt. But Rutenberg is not alone in treating this official groupthink as flat-fact.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\nWashington Post “fact-checker” Glenn Kessler awarded “four Pinocchios” – reserved for the most egregious lies – to former National Security Adviser Susan Rice for asserting last January that the Syrian government had surrendered all its chemical weapons as part of a 2013 agreement.\n\nKessler declared: “The reality is that there were confirmed chemical weapons attacks by Syria – and that U.S. and international officials had good evidence that Syria had not been completely forthcoming in its declaration [regarding its surrendered chemicals], and possibly retained sarin and VX nerve agent …. and that the Syrian government still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement,” i.e., the chlorine cases.\n\nBut Kessler has no way of actually knowing what the truth is regarding Syria’s alleged chemical weapons use. He is simply repeating the propagandistic groupthink that has overwhelmed the Syrian crisis. Presumably he would have given four Pinocchios to anyone who had doubted the 2003 claims about Iraq hiding WMD because all the Important People “knew” that to be true at the time.\n\nWhat neither Rutenberg nor Kessler seems willing or capable of addressing is the larger problem created by the U.S. government and its NATO allies investing heavily in information warfare or what is sometimes called “strategic communications,” claiming that they are defending themselves from Russian “active measures.” However, the impact of all these competing psychological operations is to trample reality.\n\nThe role of an honest press corps should be to apply skepticism to all official stories, not carry water for “our side” and reject anything coming from the “other side,” which is what The New York Times, The Washington Post and the rest of the Western mainstream media have done, especially regarding Middle East policies and now the New Cold War with Russia.\n\nThe American people and other news consumers have a right to expect that the Western media will recall the old adage that there are almost always two sides to a story. There’s also the truism that truth often resides not at the surface but is hidden beneath.\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

For instance, if a U.S. government official voices “high confidence” in a supposed “intelligence assessment,” that usually means “we don’t have any real evidence, but we figure that if we say ‘high confidence’ enough that no one will dare challenge us.”\n\nIt’s also true that after a U.S. President or another senior official jumps to a conclusion that is not supported by evidence, the ranks of government careerists will close around him or her, making any serious or objective investigation almost impossible. Plus, if the dubious allegations are directed at some “enemy” state, then the mainstream media also will suppress skepticism. Prestigious “news” outlets will run “fact checks” filled with words in capital letters: “MISLEADING”; “FALSE”; or maybe “FAKE NEWS.”\n\nWhich is where things stand regarding President Trump’s rush to judgment within hours about an apparent chemical weapons incident in Syria’s Idlib province on April 4. Despite the fact that much of the information was coming from Al Qaeda and its propaganda-savvy allies, the mainstream U.S. media rushed emotional images onto what Trump calls “the shows” – upon which he says he bases his foreign policy judgments – and he blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the scores of deaths, including “beautiful little babies,” as Trump declared.\n\nGiven the neocon/liberal-interventionist domination of Official Washington’s foreign policy – and the professional Western propaganda shops working for Assad’s overthrow – there was virtually no pushback against the quick formulation of this new groupthink. All the predictable players played their predictable parts, from The New York Times to CNN to the Atlantic Council-related Bellingcat and its “citizen journalists.”\n\nAll the Important People who appeared on the TV shows or who were quoted in the mainstream media trusted the images provided by Al Qaeda-related propagandists and ignored documented prior cases in which the Syrian rebels staged chemical weapons incidents to implicate the Assad government.\n\n‘We All Know’\n\nOne smug CNN commentator pontificated, “we all know what happened in 2013,” a reference to the enduring conventional wisdom that an Aug. 21, 2013 sarin attack outside Damascus was carried out by the Assad government and that President Obama then failed to enforce his “red line” against chemical weapons use. This beloved groupthink survives even though evidence later showed the operation was carried out by rebels, most likely by Al Qaeda’s Nusra Front with help from Turkish intelligence, as investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported and brave Turkish officials later confirmed.\n\nBut Official Washington’s resistance to reality was perhaps best demonstrated one year ago when The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg published a detailed article about Obama’s foreign policy that repeated the groupthink about Obama shrinking from his “red line” but included the disclosure that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had informed the President that U.S. intelligence lacked any “slam dunk” evidence that Assad’s military was guilty.\n\nOne might normally think that such a warning from DNI Clapper would have spared Obama from the media’s judgment that he had chickened out, especially given the later evidence pointing the finger of blame at the rebels. After all, why should Obama have attacked the Syrian military and killed large numbers of soldiers and possibly civilians in retaliation for a crime that they had nothing to do with – and indeed an offense for which the Assad government was being framed? But Official Washington’s propaganda bubble is impervious to inconvenient reality.\n\nNor does anyone seem to know that a United Nations report disclosed testimonies from eyewitnesses about how rebels and their allied “rescue workers” had staged one “chlorine attack” so it would be blamed on the Assad government. Besides these Syrians coming forward to expose the fraud, the evidence that had been advanced to “prove” Assad’s guilt included bizarre claims from the rebels and their friends that they could tell that chlorine was inside a “barrel bomb” because of the special sound that it made while it was descending.\n\nDespite the exposure of that one frame-up, the U.N. investigators – under intense pressure from Western governments to give them something to pin on the Assad regime – accepted rebel claims about two other alleged chlorine attacks, an implausible finding that is now repeatedly cited by the Western media even as it ignores the case of the debunked “chlorine attack.” Again, one might think that proof of two staged chemical weapons attacks – one involving sarin and the other chlorine – would inject some skepticism about the April 4 case, but apparently not.\n\nAll that was left was for President Trump to “act presidential” and fire off 59 Tomahawk missiles at some Syrian airbase on April 6, reportedly killing several Syrian soldiers and nine civilians, including four children, collateral damage that the mainstream U.S. media knows not to mention in its hosannas of praise for Trump’s decisiveness.\n\nHome-Free Groupthink\n\nThere might be some pockets of resistance to the groupthink among professional analysts at the CIA, but their findings – if they contradict what the President has already done – will be locked away probably for generations if not forever.\n\nIn other words, the new Assad-did-it groupthink appeared to be home free, a certainty that The New York Times could now publish without having to add annoying words like “alleged” or “possibly,” simply stating Assad’s guilt as flat-fact.\n\nThomas L. Friedman, the Times’ star foreign policy columnist, did that and then extrapolated from his certainty to propose that the U.S. should ally itself with the jihadists fighting to overthrow Assad, a position long favored by U.S. “allies,” Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\n“Why should our goal right now be to defeat the Islamic State in Syria?” Friedman asked before proposing outright support for the jihadists: “We could dramatically increase our military aid to anti-Assad rebels, giving them sufficient anti-tank and antiaircraft missiles to threaten Russian, Iranian, Hezbollah and Syrian helicopters and fighter jets and make them bleed, maybe enough to want to open negotiations. Fine with me.”\n\nSo, not only have the mainstream U.S. media stars decided that they know what happen on April 4 in a remote Al Qaeda-controlled section of Idlib province (without seeing any real evidence) but they are now building off their groupthink to propose that the Trump administration hand out antiaircraft missiles to the “anti-Assad rebels” who, in reality, are under the command of Al Qaeda and/or the Islamic State.\n\nIn other words, Friedman and other deep thinkers are advocating material support for terrorists who would get sophisticated American ground-to-air missiles that could shoot down Russian planes thus exacerbating already dangerous U.S.-Russian tensions or take down some civilian airliner as Al Qaeda has done in the past. If someone named Abdul had made such a suggestion, he could expect a knock on his door from the FBI.\n\nExpert Skepticism\n\nYet, before President Trump takes Friedman’s advice – arming up Al Qaeda and entering into a de facto alliance with Islamic State – we might want to make sure that we aren’t being taken in again by a clever Al Qaeda psychological operation, another staged chemical weapons attack.\n\nWith the U.S. intelligence community effectively silenced by the fact that the President has already acted, Theodore Postol, a technology and national security expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, undertook his own review of the supposed evidence cited by Trump’s White House in issuing a four-page “intelligence assessment” on April 11 asserting with “high confidence” that Assad’s military delivered a bomb filled with sarin on the town of Khan Sheikdoun on the morning of April 4.\n\nPostol, whose analytical work helped debunk Official Washington’s groupthink regarding the 2013 sarin attack outside Damascus, expressed new shock at the shoddiness of the latest White House report (or WHR). Postol produced “a quick turnaround assessment” of the April 11 report that night and went into greater detail in an addendum on April 13, writing:\n\n“This addendum provides data that unambiguously shows that the assumption in the WHR that there was no tampering with the alleged site of the sarin release is not correct. This egregious error raises questions about every other claim in the WHR. … The implication of this observation is clear – the WHR was not reviewed and released by any competent intelligence expert unless they were motivated by factors other than concerns about the accuracy of the report.\n\n“The WHR also makes claims about ‘communications intercepts’ which supposedly provide high confidence that the Syrian government was the source of the attack. There is no reason to believe that the veracity of this claim is any different from the now verified false claim that there was unambiguous evidence of a sarin release at the cited crater. … The evidence that unambiguously shows that the assumption that the sarin release crater was tampered with is contained in six photographs at the end of this document.”\n\nPostol notes that one key photo “shows a man standing in the alleged sarin-release crater. He is wearing a honeycomb facemask that is designed to filter small particles from the air. Other apparel on him is an open necked cloth shirt and what appear to be medical exam gloves. Two other men are standing in front of him (on the left in the photograph) also wearing honeycomb facemask’s and medical exam gloves.\n\n“If there were any sarin present at this location when this photograph was taken everybody in the photograph would have received a lethal or debilitating dose of sarin. The fact that these people were dressed so inadequately either suggests a complete ignorance of the basic measures needed to protect an individual from sarin poisoning, or that they knew that the site was not seriously contaminated.\n\n“This is the crater that is the centerpiece evidence provided in the WHR for a sarin attack delivered by a Syrian aircraft.”\n\nNo ‘Competent’ Analyst\n\nAfter reviewing other discrepancies in photos of the crater, Postol wrote: “It is hard for me to believe that anybody competent could have been involved in producing the WHR report and the implications of such an obviously predetermined result strongly suggests that this report was not motivated by a serious analysis of any kind.\n\n“This finding is disturbing. It indicates that the WHR was probably a report purely aimed at justifying actions that were not supported by any legitimate intelligence. This is not a unique situation. President George W. Bush has argued that he was misinformed about unambiguous evidence that Iraq was hiding a substantial amount of weapons of mass destruction. This false intelligence led to a US attack on Iraq that started a process that ultimately led to a political disintegration in the Middle East, which through a series of unpredicted events then led to the rise of the Islamic State.”\n\nPostol continued: “On August 30, 2013, the White House [under President Obama] produced a similarly false report about the nerve agent attack on August 21, 2013 in Damascus. This report also contained numerous intelligence claims that could not be true. An interview with President Obama published in The Atlantic in April 2016 indicates that Obama was initially told that there was solid intelligence that the Syrian government was responsible for the nerve agent attack of August 21, 2013 in Ghouta, Syria. Obama reported that he was later told that the intelligence was not solid by the then Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.\n\n“Equally serious questions are raised about the abuse of intelligence findings by the incident in 2013. Questions that have not been answered about that incident is how the White House produced a false intelligence report with false claims that could obviously be identified by experts outside the White House and without access to classified information. There also needs to be an explanation of why this 2013 false report was not corrected. …\n\n“It is now obvious that a second incident similar to what happened in the Obama administration has now occurred in the Trump administration. In this case, the president, supported by his staff, made a decision to launch 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base. This action was accompanied by serious risks of creating a confrontation with Russia, and also undermining cooperative efforts to win the war against the Islamic State. …\n\n“I therefore conclude that there needs to be a comprehensive investigation of these events that have either misled people in the White House, or worse yet, been perpetrated by people seeking to force decisions that were not justified by the cited intelligence. This is a serious matter and should not be allowed to continue.”\n\nWhile Postol’s appeal for urgent attention to this pattern of the White House making false intelligence claims – now implicating three successive administrations – makes sense, the likelihood of such an undertaking is virtually nil. The embarrassment and loss of “credibility” for not only the U.S. political leadership but the major U.S. news outlets would be so severe, especially in the wake of the WMD fiasco in Iraq, that no establishment figure or organization would undertake such a review.\n\nInstead, Official Washington’s propaganda bubble will stay firmly in place allowing its inhabitants to go happily about their business believing that they are the caretakers of “truth.”\n\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

But this time the uncertainty amid the collapse of mainstream candidates is making many take his chances far more seriously.\n\n🇫🇷 LATEST: French election is closer than ever. Polls show Mélenchon, should he reach the second round, could win against Fillon or Le Pen. — Keith Walker (@KeithWalkerNews) April 14, 2017\n\nThe head of “La France Insoumise” (Unsubmissive or Unbowed) inspires an emotional response among many on the French left. It would be wrong to dismiss the 65-year-old as a socialist relic: his campaign has been generally praised as the most successful, with its shrewd use of social media and campaign techniques including virtual appearances at rallies via hologram.\n\nThe veteran who broke with the Socialist Party in 2008 remains an outsider, but the prospect of the Communist-backed candidate making it to the presidential run-off – and maybe further still – is no longer seen as impossible.\n\nThe setting in Marseille was symbolic given the large local population of North African origin: Mélenchon is diametrically opposed to the nativism of his far-right rival Marine Le Pen, and says he is at ease with France as an ethnic “melting-pot”. The country is naturally anchored in the Mediterranean with the French-speaking nations of the Maghreb, he argues. Poignantly he paid tribute to the many migrants who had died at sea trying to reach Europe.\n\nWhile his supporters exalt in what they see as the incarnation of policies grounded in social solidarity to challenge the neo-liberal economic order, Mélenchon’s detractors castigate what they see as a basket-case programme of Latin American proportions. “Mélenchon: the crazy manifesto of the French Chavez,” ran the front-page headline in the right-wing newspaper Le Figaro this week. While the emergence of another Eurosceptic challenger in the race alongside the Front National leader has unleashed market jitters and set brows sweating across the EU.\n\nMélenchon campaign made an online video game where he shakes money out of corrupt French right-wing politicians.https://t.co/rDwdOQwvbX — InteGritty (@lnteGritty) April 8, 2017\n\nHere are some examples of the main policies as set out in Mélenchon’s programme “L’Avenir en Commun” (A Common Future) and in the candidate’s speeches and interviews.\n\nInternational\n\nnegotiate a “democratic reconstruction” of European treaties. In case of failure, withdraw from the European Union. Several conditions attached to remaining in the euro. Pull out of the EU’s Stability Pact and fight for an overhaul of sovereign debt. Stop free-market policies which “ruin developing economies and destroy European industry”. Propose an alliance with southern European countries to counter austerity. Respect Brexit without “punishing” the UK for its decision to leave the EU, but withdraw from the “Le Touquet” accord which places British border controls in France.\n\nstop negotiations with the US on a free-trade agreement and reject the CETA deal with Canada.\n\ndeal with Canada. withdraw from NATO and the World Bank. Refuse any permanent military mission unless backed by the UN.\n\nand the World Bank. Refuse any permanent military mission unless backed by the UN. develop closer ties with Russia.\n\njoin ALBA : formerly the “Bolivarian alliance” set up by Latin American presidents Castro and Chavez in 2004 – a system of mutual economic aid based on social welfare. Observer countries include Syria and Iran. Even left-wing journalists point out the “democratic deficiencies” of Cuba and Venezuela. But Mélenchon’s team have attacked the way they have been vilified on this, saying adhesion would give a voice to French Guiana and France’s Caribbean territories.\n\nUn dessin de 2011 de Plantu, tristement d'actualité.

Mélenchon is against localised negotiating practices, insisting France can have “only one ‘Code du Travail’ (Labour code)”.\n\nlimit executive pay.\n\nlower the retirement age to 60 on a full pension.\n\nseparate investment banks from other banking operations.\n\nThe Environment\n\nadopt a “Green Rule”: the principle of not using more of the planet’s resources than can be put back. Mélenchon believes this should be Brussels’ “Golden Rule” instead of aiming to get the public deficit under three percent of GDP .\n\n. move to 100% renewable energy by 2050, via a ditching of nuclear power on which France currently depends. “A machine to create millions of jobs”, the candidate says.\n\nC’est le peuple qui fait l’histoire.

Many people have been caught unawares by Theresa May’s decision.\n\nShe has said she does not want to be distracted by time-consuming campaigning.

All the same, I can tell you I don’t blame Muslims or anything like that, that’s got nothing to do with it, but now, with all these migrants coming in we have to stop. There’s already no work, so I say closing the frontiers would be great,” says former accountant Laurence.\n\n“We’ve already tried everything so now there’s only Marine left. She’s got to get in, and then we’ll see. We want to be able to give our children a future, and I think that’s important. Today not even we know where we’re going, so where they’re headed I have no idea,” says Laurence’s daughter, Sabrina, a hotel cleaner.\n\nResist!\n\nNot everyone in Beaucaire is satisfied with the Sanchez way. The division that the FN has established has united the opposition parties, who make a public show of their resistance. They are critical of what they dub a brainwashing PR offensive, larded with fake news, and the 60-odd costly legal challenges the Mayor has had to face. If their local experience is anything to go by, Marine Le Pen would be a terrible president.\n\n“At the level of our commune the way power is being exercised is between the hands of one man, Sanchez. He doesn’t delegate, so the FN on a national scale? Imagine Marine Le Pen with her hands on the absolute power the fifth republic grants one sole individual…it’s frightening,” says member of the “Réagir pour Beaucaire” collective Stéphane Linossier.\n\nThe Beaucaire Citizens’ Collective was set up to combat racism and discrimination, and while keeping the town council under scrutiny is not opposed to it as a matter of course. However it is sounding the alarm.\n\n“Marine Le Pen attacks individual freedoms. In Beaucaire the mayor is attacking freedom of conscience and freedom of expression. If you express yourself you are automatically against Sanchez and he plays the victim. Now I’m not a politician or economist but closing frontiers and and leaving Europe is ludicrous and makes no sense. I’m a committed European,” says group member Laure Cordelet.\n\nFew FN voters here have Europe on their lips, even if dumping the euro single currency worries some. But the way the FN is flexing its political muscle locally is dividing the town, even if Julien Sanchez insists that the only division here, if one exists at all, is between those who follow the rules, and those that don’t.\n\n#GrandeSynthe Des villages du Gard démontrent que l’accueil des réfugiés est possible et vitalisant https://t.co/3J6QQGWc25 pic.twitter.com/M5G0tngDiS — Reporterre (@Reporterre) April 11, 2017\n\nMarine’s airbrushing masks FN’s deep hardcore roots says historian\n\nEuronews’ Sandrine Delorme spoke to respected French historian and researcher Valérie Igounet.\n\n“Valérie Igounet, you have spent 20 years and written several books examining the FN and in the last two years investigated the party’s electorate and how its municipalities have fared. What is the strongest message in your book based on that assignment, ‘L’illusion nationale’?”\n\nValérie Igounet:\n\n“The first thing that struck us, that we felt, was this total disillusion with French politics, a feeling that where once people believed, and now today they do not, not at all. Many people insisted that promises had been broken, either that once the cameras had stopped rolling then the politicians would disappear never to return, or that campaign pledges were not kept.\n\nThey also trust Marine Le Pen. What they say is that they trust her image, her promises, and they feel a party that’s never had a try at governing should get one. That’s a line we’ve heard a lot.”\n\neuronews:\n\n“You believe that the FN has evolved and changed but do you believe that change is deep and real, or is it just superficial, or even a front?”\n\nValérie Igounet :\n\n“Today the party says it’s of the right and left; it is even styling itself as a party for all peoples, a broad church; in Marine Le Pen’s election manifesto there are 144 promises, and there’s something for everyone.\n\nBut fundamentally the Front hasn’t changed. That needs to be said. The difference is that its electorate thinks that this woman, who has led the FN for several years now, has changed the party, and that it is not what it used to be. Some would even maintain it is no longer a racist party.\n\nWhen the hot subject is Islamophobia then yes, the FN is xenophobic, but it wears this as a badge of pride and doesn’t see it as a problem. But the “national priority” that the FN says it wants to universally apply, we can’t say that xenophobia does not play a part in that, and say that there’s no problem.”", "title": "How the FN makes a small town its own - the French far-right puts down new roots", "url": "http://www.euronews.com/2017/04/19/how-the-fn-makes-a-small-town-its-own-the-french-far-right-puts-down-new-roots", "main": "http://www.euronews.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

But Eni was determined to learn. She heard that a neighbor knew more English than a few simple words. “I’d go knocking on his door, asking him to teach me. … [Eventually] his wife took pity on me,” Dervishi said. When an older friend began studying Italian, Dervishi tagged along, and soon she added French, traveling to the capital Tirana for books. German, Spanish, and a little Portuguese — picked up watching television soap operas — followed. And, finally, her relative isolation turned to a benefit. Because her hometown, Pogradec, is on Lake Ohrid, a tourist attraction, she was able to practice her languages with international visitors.\n\nA window opened for Dervishi. “I fell in love with languages,” she said. “Through languages I was able to see a different world. It opened my imagination to what was out there.”\n\nIndeed, it was a particular phrase that set the economics major on the path to Harvard. “When I was in fourth grade, a teacher mentioned that Harvard was the best university in the world,” she said. “It stuck in my mind, this dream college.”\n\nAt that point, college itself was a dream. Her father had no formal college education, but her mother had returned to school as an adult, attending college part time during Dervishi’s youth. “Seeing her balance working two jobs at the time with intense studying, and on top of that taking care of her family, was extremely motivating,” said Dervishi. “My mother not only talked about the importance of education, but she actually showed it with her actions.”\n\nEven with such inspiration, the way forward was difficult. Dervishi’s small-town high school had no one to guide her in the application process. “My teachers hadn’t written letters of recommendation before,” she said. “I had to teach them.” When she needed to send official documents, such as transcripts, she found another hurdle. “I thought of faxing them, but there was no fax machine in my hometown.”\n\nHer persistence paid off with a full scholarship (she was accepted at 14 of the 15 colleges she applied to). But the challenges continued. “The transition from high school to college, which is already daunting, for me was coupled with moving to an entirely new country,” she said. Vending machines, for example, were new to her, as was swiping an ID card to gain entrance to a library. And even with her impressive language skills, some words eluded Dervishi. In a mathematics class freshman year, she said, “I knew how to write an equation and solve it, but I did not know how to say the ‘minus’ or ‘plus’ sign, which made speaking up in class and asking questions particularly challenging.”\n\n“It was like a learning process,” she said, in her lightly accented, fluent English. “I was discovering something new every day.”\n\nHer education has already taken her far from Albania and Cambridge. She has been granted several internships, including with the Ministry of Urban Development and Tourism of Albania (funded by the Center for European Studies) and with the Europe Research Center in Paris (established by the Harvard Business School). Last year, at the European Parliament in Brussels, she interned with the Alliance for Liberal Democracy in Europe Party, in a program funded by CES. With energy to spare, Dervishi has managed to play intramural volleyball and enjoy her runs along the Charles.\n\nBeing at Harvard, she said, “has really been a life-changing experience. I have always dreamt of traveling the world and Harvard enabled me to do that. I’ve been exposed to so many different viewpoints. I’ve met people from very, very different backgrounds and been able to learn from the best professors in the world.”\n\nRight from the start, she focused on giving back to her wider world. Freshman year, for example, she got involved in tutoring candidates for citizenship through the Institute of Politics. “That was very empowering for me,” Dervishi said, “seeing people who have always dreamt of becoming U.S. citizens, even if it was simply helping them feel more confident about their English skills.”\n\nAfter graduation, Dervishi will stay in the United States — at least for now. She has landed a consulting job in Boston, which she hopes will help her develop her quantitative skills. She wants to continue her studies, probably at business school, where she intends to pursue a master’s in international development.\n\n“I have experienced the challenges of coming from a developing country, and being here I have seen that Albania is not the only country facing these challenges,” she said. “I want to make my own contribution to solving these issues.”\n\nThat includes reaching out to students, particularly those to whom a college education may seem impossible. “Never give up on your dreams,” Dervishi said — in the language that has brought her so far — “never let your circumstances define who you are.”", "title": "Journey of Harvard College polyglot started with two words", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/journey-of-harvard-college-polyglot-started-with-two-words/", "main": "http://news.harvard.edu", "fact": "HIGH"}

Girls don’t play sports. They don’t dream of studying law, or imagine careers in politics. And attending a university like Harvard is little more than a fantasy.\n\nLuckily, Varman didn’t listen.\n\nThe economics concentrator is nearing the end of her junior year, with a spot on the women’s varsity crew team and an eye on law school. One of the keys to making that possible, she said, is financial aid.\n\nMore than half of Harvard undergrads receive financial aid, and the majority of students pay only 10 percent of annual family income, an average of $12,000 a year. Students whose family incomes are below $65,000 pay nothing.\n\n“I had known about Harvard’s financial aid before I applied, but it would be impossible to [be here] without it,” Varman said over lunch at the Kirkland House dining hall. “I would not have pursued Harvard if I did not have financial aid. I remember getting my acceptance letter, and the financial aid letter comes with it, and I remember feeling like I’d hit the jackpot.\n\n“Growing up in one of the most rural places in the world, I would never have thought” of coming to Harvard, she added. “Harvard was not something I even knew existed. The biggest thing for me would have been to just get a good job.”\n\nThese days, Varman’s ambitions are significantly higher.\n\nAn accomplished sport shooter — she holds the junior world record in the double trap event — Varman hopes to one day compete in the Olympics. She plans to attend law school and then return to India with the goal of providing legal aid in rural areas. She may eventually enter politics.\n\nBeing at Harvard, Varman said, makes it easy to entertain such ambitions.\n\n“Being here, once you have the little things taken care of, you are free to think bigger and achieve more,” she said. “Even small things like worrying about food or providing for a winter coat, you don’t have to worry about these things that might prevent you from putting your full potential into what you want to do. Being at Harvard makes it possible to pursue big dreams.”\n\nThough she’d scored among the top students in the nation on a test given to all high school seniors, Varman didn’t initially apply to Harvard, but opted to head to the University of Warwick in the U.K. to pursue a law degree. Almost immediately, however, she realized she’d have to abandon her other passion — shooting.\n\n“I just wasn’t ready to give it up,” she said. “After a semester, I decided to leave Warwick and returned to shooting and worked with NGOs, and eventually made it back again onto the Indian Shooting Team.”\n\nOver the next two years, Varman traveled the world to compete in shooting events, becoming the only athlete from Madhya Pradesh to represent India in the 2014 Commonwealth Games and winning the bronze medal at the Asian Games during her freshman fall at Harvard.\n\nIt was during her time at Warwick and competing at various shooting events that Varman came to realize she could study in the U.S. and continue to pursue her sport shooting ambitions.\n\nThe sport and her studies complement each other perfectly, she said.\n\n“For me, shooting has always gone together with education,” she said. “The mental strength that I get from it translates very well into being able to study for a long time, which meant I was able to shoot for a long time. Shooting allows you to focus and push yourself mentally.”\n\nShe added: “From when I first came to Harvard three years ago to today, I feel as if I’ve grown as much as I would have in 20 years. It’s a truly transformative experience to be here and get to talk with the outstanding professors and my amazing peers. I feel like my mind has expanded so much in this short period.”\n\nVarman hopes there’s a student in rural India who can see that a Harvard education is within reach, based on her example.\n\n“I’m just paving the path,” she said. “Once you see it’s possible, that’s the motivation for the next generation to follow.”", "title": "Harvard junior aims high with lift from financial aid", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/harvard-junior-aims-high-with-lift-from-financial-aid/", "main": "http://news.harvard.edu", "fact": "HIGH"}

But U.S. Rep. John Lewis is one.\n\nLewis, one of the “big six” leaders of the Civil Rights era, was still a student in Nashville when he embarked on the Freedom Rides to battle desegregation in 1961. He became chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and led the group’s efforts to desegregate lunch counters in the South. He also was one of the organizers and speakers at the landmark March on Washington that year.\n\nIn 1965, he co-led the march across the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma, Ala., where he and other participants were attacked by police in a Civil Rights watershed known as “Bloody Sunday.” Lewis sustained a fractured skull. In 1986, he was elected to represent Georgia’s 5th Congressional District in Washington, D.C., a position the Democrat has held since.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School will honor Lewis with the Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award for his 60-year career of advancing human rights.\n\nLewis, now 77, spoke with the Gazette on Monday about where he thinks the country is now, what more is needed to ensure liberty for all, and how he views the future.\n\nGAZETTE: The country feels more divided today than in some time. Where is America right now, and where are we going?\n\nLEWIS: I think we are at a turning point. I have been involved for almost 60 years, really. I have seen and witnessed unbelievable changes. I tell young people, especially young children, when someone says to me “nothing has changed,” I feel like saying “come and walk in my shoes. I will show you change.”\n\nI think we’re in one of the most difficult periods in our recent history as a nation and as a people. There is this sense that that’s all we’re going to do, and there’s not anything else or a role for the national government to play in helping to make real the hopes and dreams and aspirations of people. But to fulfill the dreams of so many — blacks, whites, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, Latinos — we must not let those dreams and the hopes of so many be abandoned or die. In spite of all of the progress that was made — and we’ve made progress, we’ve come a distance — we still have a distance to go.\n\nIt is my belief that the scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in American society and that people today at the highest level of government want to fan those flames. Some people may not be conscious they’re doing it, but in strange ways they’re still doing it. The Civil Rights Act of ’64, the Voting Rights Act of ’65 have been undermined in so many different ways. The Supreme Court, a few short years ago, put a dagger in the very heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThere are people who want to circumvent the lesson, the effect of these two major pieces of legislation. I think there’s still a need for people in high places, not just in government, but in the private sector, in the academic community, in the media, in business to continue to be advocates, bringing people together, and build what Martin Luther King Jr. called “the beloved community.”\n\nGAZETTE: At Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ confirmation hearing, you said, “There are forces that want to take us back. We don’t want to go back.” Is it dispiriting that so many of the issues you fought for 50 years ago appear to be targeted for unraveling by some?\n\nLEWIS: Yes, you look at the appointment of the people to this administration. So many of these individuals are just out of step and out of tune with going forward, with opening up the political process or opening up America and letting people come in. In my estimation, there’s a mean spirit moving around and through our country, and we cannot let that happen without standing up, speaking up, speaking out, and resisting.\n\nGAZETTE: What would it take to get this country to the place the Constitution envisioned, a place where all people are truly created and treated as equal?\n\nLEWIS: I think we’ve got to continue to teach and preach. We’ve got to continue to inspire people to say, “We can do it.” The election of President Barack Obama gave people so much hope. And we cannot let that sense of hope die, and we cannot let it be beaten down, or let it wither on this unbelievable American vine. I tell young children — and adults — that we must not get lost in a sea of despair. We have to be hopeful and be optimistic. Be bold, be brave, be courageous, and just get up and push and pull.\n\nGAZETTE: Where do you see hope today?\n\nLEWIS: I see it among our young people, among our children. They are so smart. The young kids, they’re just very, very smart. And they will be the leaders of the 21st century. They will take us there. So I’m not afraid. It may take a little longer for us to get there because of the recent setbacks. When I move and travel around America, I hear so many people, especially middle-aged and older people, saying, “Congressman, I feel so down; I feel so lost. Do you have a word?” Some people say, “I need a hug.” I say, “I need a hug too.” I have colleagues come to me and say, “What is the word for the day?” And I will say, “Be hopeful, be brave, love, peace.”\n\nGAZETTE: You fought the system from the outside and then the inside. Has it been worth it, and where do you feel you’ve been most effective?\n\nLEWIS: During the late ’50s and especially during the decade of the ’60s was one of my most effective periods because, growing up, I saw and tasted the bitter fruits of racism. I felt the blows of hate. It was easy, it was simple, to help organize a sit-in at a lunch counter in a restaurant or to lead a march or to get out and conduct voter registration drives. It’s unfortunate, but even still today, we have to use some of those tactics and techniques to dramatize the issue, to make it plain, to make it real so people can see it and feel it.\n\nWhen I was a student in Nashville, Tennessee, during the ’60s and we were planning the sit-ins or going on the Freedom Rides, some of my colleagues said “John, what should we do?” We need to find a way to dramatize it, to make it real, make it plain. And when I moved to Atlanta in 1963 at the age of 23, and I became a member of Dr. King’s father’s church — we called him “Daddy King” — and young Martin Luther King Jr. would be preaching and Daddy King would say, “Son, make it plain; make it real.” I really believe that the Women’s March the day after the inauguration sent a powerful message around America and around the world. People understand now, and perhaps more than ever before, the power of voting with their feet, not just casting a ballot on Election Day.\n\nGAZETTE: When you look back, do you feel like you achieved what you set out to accomplish? If not, what else is left to do, and how can that happen?\n\nLEWIS: What I think is important is that we have not yet created the “beloved community.” We’re not there; we still have a distance to go. The signs that I saw growing up, the signs that I saw in Nashville, in Atlanta, and all across the South during the ’50s and ’60s that said “white men/colored men, white women/colored women, white boys/colored boys,” those signs are gone. And the only place those signs today would appear and we would see them would be in a book, in a museum, or in a video.\n\nBut we have these invisible signs that discriminate or put people down. I think it’s a shame and a disgrace today that in America we have hundreds and thousands and millions of people, and especially young children, living in fear. They’re afraid to go to school, they’re afraid to leave their homes, they’re afraid that their mothers or their fathers or their grandparents will be taken from them and they will be sent to some prison or jail or put on a bus, a plane, and be taken back to some other part of the world. When Pope Francis came and spoke to a joint session of Congress, he said we’re all immigrants; we all come from some other place. We need to deal with the whole question of immigration reform and set people on a path to citizenship.\n\nGAZETTE: What do you say to young people who want to work for change but aren’t sure what they can do or where they can be most effective?\n\nLEWIS: I say to young people all the time, whether in high school or college or young people out in the work force or working on Capitol Hill, I say when you see something that’s not right, not fair, not just, you cannot afford to be silent. You have to do something. Wherever you find yourself, speak up, speak out, and find a way to get in the way, to get in what I call “good trouble, necessary trouble.”\n\nWhen I was growing up, and asked my mother and my father, my grandparents, and my great-grandparents about the signs and about segregation, they would always say, “Don’t get in trouble; don’t get in the way.” But I met Rosa Parks when I was 17, and the next year, at the age of 18, I met Dr. King. And those two individuals inspired me to get into what I call “good trouble.” And I’ve been getting into trouble ever since.\n\nThis interview was edited for clarity and length.", "title": "Civil Rights icon John Lewis headed to Harvard, sees work ahead to guarantee rights", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/civil-rights-icon-john-lewis-headed-to-harvard-sees-work-ahead-to-guarantee-rights/", "main": "http://news.harvard.edu", "fact": "HIGH"}

But they also lamented the lack of institutional bases to monitor cases of racial discrimination and to promote Afro-Cuban history and culture. They complained about an educational system in which black themes are utterly absent and called for a thorough reexamination of school curricula in Cuba.

She has worked for four years to develop from a science newbie into a senior about to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in neurobiology with her sights set on medical school.\n\nBut Bourgeois is no science geek. She’s also a painter, a cartoonist for the Harvard Lampoon, and a standup comedian with an improv group. She’s concerned that medical school’s infamous pressures will squeeze the art out of her life.\n\nSo, she’s going to Scotland.\n\nBourgeois is one of a handful of seniors embarking on a Michael Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship for the year after graduation. The fellowship will allow them to explore the world — and themselves ­— by immersing in a foreign culture. The fellowship discourages formal academic study or work preparatory to a career. Its website states that the year “should be planned with the idea of exploration, challenge, and new discovery.”\n\nThat appeals to Bourgeois, whose improv experiences with Three Letter Acronym, or TLA, sparked an interest in storytelling, which found further expression in her cartooning and personal art and her membership on the Harvard Advocate’s art board.\n\nAfter graduation it’s off to Edinburgh, home to the Scottish Storytelling Center and host to an annual arts festival that features storytelling. Bourgeois will study the Scottish tradition of ceilidh, a festive gathering involving storytelling through poems, songs, and dance. She is still figuring out the details, but said that having the fellowship to look forward to has allowed her to enjoy her last months on campus without the uncertainty many seniors feel as Commencement approaches.\n\n“Art is about finding stories that are meaningful and translating them through painting, through comedy, and making them meaningful again to the audience,” Bourgeois said.\n\nBourgeois sees the year as a time to develop her own storytelling skills, to connect with the local Scottish arts scene, and to give her creative side free rein and see where it takes her.\n\nBut she’s trying not to become too attached to any plan. Former Rockefeller Fellows have told her that the fellowship’s open and unstructured nature means that they often found themselves on paths sometimes far different from those they envisioned.\n\n“They said, ‘You think that’s what you’re going to do. The one thing I can tell you is that you will not do the thing you set out to do,’” Bourgeois said. “I’m surprisingly OK with that. [This year is] to figure myself out.”\n\nBourgeois grew up in New Orleans and attended a girls Catholic high school. As a senior, she enrolled in programs at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, leaving school halfway through the day to travel across town.\n\n“I was always a girl covered in paint, it was my thing,” Bourgeois said. “[My parents] always laughed about the starving artist thing, even though it’s the thing that I do best.”\n\nBut under the paint was a budding interest in science. Sparked by her brother’s autism, Bourgeois began watching TED talks about the brain and became fascinated by the differences that result in autism and how the brain’s physical processes translate into, as she put it, memories of one’s grandmother or the smell of cookies.\n\nWhen she arrived at Harvard, she decided on a neurobiology concentration. It didn’t go well at first. Bourgeois had a strong grounding in biology, but didn’t feel as prepared for other scientific subjects.\n\nA key development was finding the self-described group “biobabes,” women science concentrators who gathered weekly for dinner and study. Bourgeois found herself immersed — eating, sleeping, dreaming about science — even finding the traditionally tough pre-med offering of organic chemistry to be one of her favorite classes.\n\n“I’d go on runs and think about benzene, a very stable molecule: I am benzene today!” Bourgeois said. “It was the most immersive academic experience I had.”\n\nRyan Draft, assistant director of undergraduate studies in neurobiology and Bourgeois’ adviser, described her as “a serious student of science,” one who is “unique,” with broad academic interests.\n\n“Although I have not seen her perform, there is a certain confidence and adventurousness that is palpable when you meet her, which must come from her experiences on stage,” Draft said. “Having a year to explore a new culture provides the time and raw materials to reflect deeply on life and try out new and unconventional ideas about yourself.”\n\nFreshman year was also tough outside the classroom, when her attempt to join the Lampoon was unsuccessful. On a whim, Bourgeois tried out for Three Letter Acronym. Though she’d never done improv, Bourgeois said she immediately liked the form’s spontaneity and the trust that exists between performers. Being able to get a few laughs didn’t hurt.\n\n“I just remember feeling bliss, a pure brain state of joy,” Bourgeois said. “I’ve never been able to trust so many strangers who randomly throw out an idea and take it so literally: ‘Oh, yes, you are a crazy grandmother in Poland.’ And to have people laugh like that. That was the best afternoon I had on this campus. Period.”\n\nBourgeois called improv “the thing that kept me alive” during good times and hard times, something of an extracurricular home.\n\nBy her junior year, Bourgeois had most of her pre-med requirements completed. She hadn’t touched a paintbrush or a drawing pencil for two years, so she took a silk screen class. Her project, a multilayered work illustrating a woman’s battle with breast cancer, married her interests in art and science. The viewer sees through layers of translucent fabric as the woman progresses through the disease, from diagnosis to chemotherapy, and then death.\n\nBourgeois took a second artistic step that year, trying again and getting on the Lampoon.\n\n“The most important things that happened to me here happened to me by accident,” Bourgeois said. “A lot of it is failing. It’s to be cut [from the Lampoon] … to realize you suck at science [but keep at it] until you don’t suck at science anymore … to go to office hours and admit you don’t know.”\n\nOther art courses followed, including one on animation, which Bourgeois says is a recent passion.\n\nMatthew Saunders, assistant professor of visual and environmental studies, taught the animation course and a painting class Bourgeois took.\n\n“She has a sense of humor,” Saunders said. “She was fearless in class and jumped right into everything.”\n\nBourgeois is looking forward to art editing the Lampoon’s Commencement issue, including drawing the cover. Now while she runs, she’s not thinking about stable molecules but listening to standup routines and imagining cartoons.\n\n“Two dinosaurs think a chicken is their baby and one thinks the other is cheating,” Bourgeois said. “It’s an evolution joke.”", "title": "Harvard senior puts pin in neurobiology, comedy, and art to embark on Rockefeller Fellowship", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/harvard-senior-puts-pin-in-neurobiology-comedy-and-art-to-embark-on-rockefeller-fellowship/", "main": "http://news.harvard.edu", "fact": "HIGH"}

She is on the National Steering Committee of the March for science. She is a visiting professor at Harvard Divinity School and an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana.\n\nHarvard Political Review: On April 22, 2017, people across the country will take to the streets as a part of the March for Science. Why are they protesting?\n\nRosalyn LaPier: I would argue the March for Science is not necessarily a “protest,” but a march that is for science. We are advocating for something, not protesting against something. The March is about bringing together scientists, people who are science educators, people who are interested in science, and citizens who are impacted by science in their everyday lives. It’s to bring people together to advocate, or continue to advocate, for science in our American democracy.\n\nHPR: The Atlantic counts 21 distinct goals for the March outlined in texts published by the organizers, ranging from celebrating science to increasing its diversity. How do you balance so many different ideas into one protest movement?\n\nRL: I would distill it all down to one thing, which is that the March for Science is advocating for science. I know that there are a lot of ideas on the list. We update our website almost on a daily basis, so if you visit day-to-day, there is going to be something new that we have added. There’s always going to be something new added to that list. The most important thing is to make sure that science stays on the agenda of not only public policy makers in Washington D.C., but also in citizens’ minds as to the importance of science in everyday life.\n\nHPR: Some scientists, including Robert Young at the New York Times, have described the March as “[politicizing] the science we care so much about.” How do you respond to this criticism?\n\nRL: I would say that science plays many roles in society; it definitely plays many roles in a democratic society. It is impossible to be completely apolitical, but I think that science is nonpartisan. There really is a difference between being not partisan and being political. This is something I run into personally when I work with people in Washington D.C. related to issues that are in Native American communities and environmental justice issues. I always remind anybody I talk to in Congress or in D.C. that Native American issues or environmental justice issues or environmental issues are not partisan issues. Those are issues that impact everybody.\n\nIf you are being impacted by unclean water, it’s not a political issue. It’s whether the water is clean or unclean. I think that folks who are working to address those issues – scientists who are working to address those issues, but also citizens who are working to address those issues – don’t view science as political. They view it as nonpartisan. But they do view it as part of the world that we live in.\n\nHPR: The March for Science follows on the heels of the Women’s March earlier this year. Why in the time of social media do you think the march remains a potent form of protest?\n\nRL: People like to get together; that’s the basic answer. As humans, we like to be able to have our voices be heard, but we also enjoy making something, such as advocating for science or advocating for any issue, into a social occasion that can then turn into a social movement. It’s very hard, especially in cyberspace, to get a sense of if something is becoming a social movement. It’s hard to see the numbers out there.\n\nIt’s a lot easier when you have a lot of people coming together around a particular cause or a particular issue. One of the things that we saw with the Women’s March, because they had the satellite marches as well, is you saw the number of people that were in D.C. who were supporting that concern, but you also saw the satellite marches, and you saw that there was this collective action that was occurring across the United States that helps people then view their position or their stance collectively, and not as individuals.\n\nHPR: Native American organizations were among the first to announce support for the March for Science. Why do you think these groups were so eager to support the March?\n\nRL: Three of the first organizations to partner with the March for Science were the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, the Society Advancing Chicano and Native Americans in Science, and the National Coalition of Native American Language Schools and Programs. All three of them saw this as a great opportunity to continue to encourage their members to pursue science.\n\nThey saw that this was something important for them to participate in so that their voices could be a part of the conversation. They would be seen as part of the community of science. There are indigenous people in the science community who are interested in promoting the idea of indigenous science as something that is parallel to Western science, and that indigenous science should also be viewed as something that is important to the academy.\n\nHPR: You are a scholar of indigenous religion and a member of the Blackfeet/Métis tribe. How does the state of science today impact indigenous communities?\n\nRL: Science has played an important role in Native American communities, both in the past and recently. I can give you a few examples. One example is that environmental scientists in particular, and people who work on conducting Environmental Impact Statements, have played an important role in many indigenous communities to help them look at environmental issues within their community by drawing on a lot of different disciplines within science to be able to then make decisions and address certain issues. Whether it is something being built in their community, or whether they are thinking about doing certain types of development, Environmental Impact Statements are extremely helpful. One of the things that has been occurring recently in Native American communities is there has been much more of a push to train from within, more people being sent to study science, technology, engineering, and math. Then those people come back to the indigenous communities to address, again, primarily environmental issues.\n\nA second example would be medical science. There are a lot of health disparities that indigenous communities have – for example, diabetes is disproportionately high in indigenous communities, and there has been a lot of research lately that is looking at diabetes not only in indigenous communities but in other communities as well. Medical science is beginning to help indigenous communities address health issues that are disproportionately prevalent.\n\nA third example would be within the social sciences. Folks who do clinical psychology or social work are addressing issues like trauma or historic trauma within indigenous communities. There has been a lot of really good research that has been done lately in those fields. Because of that research, indigenous communities can begin to address issues such as the incredibly high suicide rate among indigenous youth in our communities.\n\nThere are several different ways in which science has been extremely helpful to indigenous communities and is helping address things that we are interested in. There have been many great partnerships between scientists and individual communities. Historically, one of the criticisms that indigenous communities had of science was that scientists would choose their own project without input from the indigenous community and do a study that did not help or did not have any true impact on the indigenous community. I think that is changing. Most projects that are done now are almost always done in partnership with indigenous communities, so that the indigenous community can help inform and say, ‘this is what we want. This is what is going to be helpful to us,’ versus scientists coming in and saying, ‘this is what we are going to study.’ That has made a huge difference and has greatly impacted in a positive way those relationships.\n\nHPR: What would you say is at stake in the March?\n\nRL: In the past year, the Standing Rock Lakota have been in an ongoing fight with the U.S. government over the Missouri River and over the building of a pipeline underneath the Missouri River. From the very beginning, the Standing Rock Lakota have asked the government and the Army Corps of Engineers to have an Environmental Impact Statement. From the very beginning, the Standing Rock Lakota have been asking for scientists. They have been asking for environmental scientists. They have been asking for archaeologists. They have been asking for cultural anthropologists who look at religion and sacred sites: all to conduct an EIS so that then they as a community, and also the U.S. government, can look at that and try and address some of the issues that they believe are going to occur once this pipeline is built.\n\nThey have gone to court numerous times, and they have lost every single time. There was also a huge protest that lasted months and months and months out on the Standing Rock reservation and also on Lakota lands off-reservation. That’s an example where a tribal government and a tribal community was asking the U.S. government to use science and scientists to address a potential environmental justice issue, to address a potential issue related to sacred sites and sacred place. It’s an example when the U.S. government has said that they are not going to use science or scientists.\n\nWhat’s at stake in a march, such as the March for Science, is that we need to remind not only policymakers but also citizens of the United States that science is important and that science can help communities make decisions. When a community such as Standing Rock goes to court over and over and over again and loses every single time, that’s what they are asking for. They will not know what the potential harm is until it occurs. If they had an opportunity at the beginning to ask scientists to participate in the policymaking, the decision-making of what was going to occur, they would at least have some answers.\n\nWhat’s at stake is how these decisions are going to be made. We have a precedent right now, and the precedent was set during the first week of the new administration when the president signed two different executive orders: one stating that there is going to be an expedited EIS process, which actually never occurred, and that there would be an expedited EIS process for any pipeline or environmental National Environmental Policy Act decision. He also signed an executive order to expedite the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nWhat he was doing with those executive orders was saying that science was no longer necessary, that science and scientists no longer would be included in the decision-making process. When we look at development within the United States, and especially when we look at potential environmental degradation, we need to listen to how that impacts people, how it impacts citizens on the ground, even in middle-of-nowhere North Dakota.\n\nImage Source: Flickr/montanaalumni", "title": "Marching for Science: Interview with Rosalyn LaPier", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/online/marching-science-interview-rosalyn-lapier/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-03 14:26:13-04:00", "authors": ["Charles Horan"], "content": "Many people are familiar with Einstein’s remark, “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” The comment came when the philosopher Bertrand Russell was met with opposition, ultimately successful, to his teaching a class at the City College of New York, his prior remarks on sexual morality having disqualified him in the eyes of some conservatives.\n\nThe line is a good one, but of course it has some corollaries we would do well to recognize. For instance, it is the case that in some cases great and decent spirits will encounter support from violent mediocrities. This may be because a mediocrity is confused or because he is devious: he may stumble into support accidentally, irrationally; or, suffering from a poor reputation, he may attach himself to a promising opponent whom thereby to drag down.\n\nThe Case of Keith Ellison\n\nBy way of example: in February, shortly before the election for the chair of the Democratic National Committee, one candidate for the post, Keith Ellison, a black congressman from Minnesota and the first Muslim member of Congress, was endorsed by a notorious white supremacist, David Duke. Duke had in 2016 endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, for which Trump received derision. Some dubious reactionaries rushed to ask why Ellison was not indicted by this endorsement, as Trump had been. These included the folks behind the unpropitiously named program Louder with Crowder. “HYPOCRISY ALERT!” they observed. The question is raised whether a politician is necessarily culpable for his or her endorsement by a bigot, and whether politicians endorsed by the same bad person are equally implicated.\n\nSeparate endorsements by one person are not necessarily equal; beyond the mere fact of each endorsement’s having been made, substantive distinctions can be drawn between them. We have to decide for ourselves whether a Duke-endorsed candidate has earned Duke’s endorsement, by displaying principles of similar reprehensibility. In the case of Trump, we should suppose that he has earned Duke’s endorsement: he has made innumerable bigoted statements, and refused to push back against those made on his behalf, and thereby earned the support of a notorious bigot. Ellison, who has no similar record, and gives no impression of sharing any principles or priorities with Duke, has not equally earned his endorsement, and is not equally (or at all) culpable for it.\n\nSome events that appear identical are so only in some partial, subsidiary respect, and when considered more fully, in proper context, become clearly distinct and separate. The receipt of a bigot’s endorsement is such a case. By way of further example, in the case of a dispute between exploited workers and a tycoon trying to crush them, each side is defending its economic interest. To this extent the sides are identical. However, the sides are distinguishable by the justice of their causes, of the interests they are promoting: the workers are promoting what may be considered their own just interests, whereas the tycoon’s interest may be considered unjust.\n\nThe Problem of Association: the GOP Example\n\nThis matter of superficial identity-relations has further applications to today’s politics. We might consider the question of obstructionism committed against a president by the opposition party. We can consider two extremely recent examples: of the obstructionism perpetrated over eight years by Congressional Republicans against President Obama, and a hypothetical equivalent campaign to be waged by the Congress’s Democrats against Trump. I tend not to believe in the supposed “responsibility to govern” that would compel the opposition party to acquiesce at least partly in a president’s designs. Reduction to the absurd serves the useful purpose sometimes of showing us that supposed universal rules do not apply in certain cases and must be rethought, case by case. To give the most egregious example: If the president were Hitler, the Congressional opposition would have no mandate to capitulate to him in the name of “responsible governance,” but would be responsible only for opposing his policies as efficaciously as possible, as their discerning consciences saw fit. This speaks to something about heads of state: as they are powerful, they are dangerous, and must always be contested, in good faith.\n\nSo the Republicans in Congress during Obama’s presidency had the right to oppose him as they saw fit, or as was properly seen fit, and the Democrats in Congress now have the right to oppose Trump as far as he should be opposed. If the Congressional opposition to Trump is as inveterate as that to Obama, that does not delegitimize either oppositional program, but leaves us to consider whether the superficially identical oppositions differ as to the legitimacy of arguments that can be given for their propriety. That is, a program of unyielding opposition to Trump may be appropriate, whereas the unyielding opposition to Obama may not have been, depending on whether there is a difference between the two presidents, and in the seriousness of their opponents’ prerogatives. Complicated arguments could be given in each case; I won’t try to give them in this space.\n\nI will be satisfied to say that I think there are clear qualitative differences between the presidencies of Obama and Trump, and that we would be well served to oppose the latter in virtually all cases. Those who would oppose him should remember to make their criticisms properly, without being distracted by the absurdity of their target. The long-running joke about the size of Trump’s hands is an example of a joke that should be more subtle than it is sometimes given to be: what is risible is not the anatomic fact of the hands’ smallness, but that the man whom they belong to is so vacuous and petty as to be mortified to have them.\n\nCommander-in-Chief\n\nTrump has a distracting personality. He speaks in platitudes. He often seems nearly illiterate. On Twitter he has self-quoted: “I like thinking big. To me it’s very simple: if you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.” This line appeared in The Art of the Deal, the 1987 book Trump ostensibly wrote, and again in 2012, exactly a month after Obama’s re-election, in the quoted tweet. It seems safe to say that no one who has ever spared a moment’s thought for thinking has ever had this thought, let alone thought to express it.\n\nThe promotion of “thinking big” as good thinking might be called an example of proxy-thinking: thinking not in the terms in which we should think, but in terms of (namely, unrepresentative) proxy-terms. All instances of the drawing of false identities – between the shamefulnesses of separate endorsements by a bigot, or between the proprieties of defending different kinds of economic interest, or the opposing different presidents – are examples of proxy-thinking.\n\nAnother example would be the indiscriminate privileging of one point on the notional political spectrum over another (without considering the relevant arguments for specific propositions): for instance, the popular privileging of the “center.” Contained here is the supposition that the middle of the political spectrum should enjoy some automatic privilege over either extremity. This interpretation, while convenient for establishmentarian agenda-setters in Washington, seems not quite sensible. Although we are familiar with the term “centrism,” and have an impression of what sense it is supposed to convey, it is still hard to know what “center” really means; it seems difficult to suppose that all political thinking can really be represented one-dimensionally, and that there would be a definable center-point in this dimension. And even if there were some such center-point, there would still be the matter of deciding what about it would serve necessarily to legitimate it at the expense of alternatives. (And none of this is to engage with the empirical reality that “centrist” politicians and their elite allies scoff at programs of redistribution that the average voter, data tell us, would support.)\n\nThinking Precisely\n\nOther examples clearly abound. For instance, take the executive order signed by the president that mandated that for any new federal regulation to be imposed, two existing regulations be stricken – not a policy that engages substantively with the proper scope and function of the regulatory apparatus, based on the set of specific cases, but a boon to those who wish simply to see an absolute reduction in the number of regulations on the books.\n\nAnalogical arguments like the one made by Louder with Crowder are nonsensical under any analysis; they can be believed, but they cannot quite be thought. They are at odds with the rules on which all depend(s). They can only be tropistically imbibed. This suggests that there is an especially potent case of false identity that is the identity of the inconsiderate reactionary, who tries to build an ideology in terms of the incoherent existing framework he has presumed and contrived. This actually may supply some hope: as deprivation may yield depravity, these elements of false consciousness may obstruct real consciences.\n\nTo avoid the misfortune of being utterly misguided and self-alienated one can take some steps. We should think precisely. In general, generality should be a matter simply of applied specificity. We should mistrust anyone who tells us, “Trust no one” – if he doesn’t wish to undercut from the first his own statement, he means to mislead: he means, “Trust no one but me, who warned you to trust [no one].” The same caution should apply in cases when we are told to rush, to ignore details, so as to “see the big picture” – the big picture is a function of the collation of the members of the set of smaller pictures, and all of these that are relevant must be seen: this is the “big picture.” It is important to remember that while no one else can expect of you anything better than your best, you can’t expect anything better than that, either.\n\nImage Credit: Michael Vadon", "title": "Slander by Association: the Problem with Endorsements", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/slander-by-association-the-problem-with-endorsements/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

While this presidential push marked the first concerted federal effort on the topic, the movement for expanded computer science education started long before.\n\nAs early as 2009, the organization, Technology Education and Literacy in Schools, started matching professional technologists with public schools to create more computer science classes. In 2013, another organization, Code.org was founded to achieve this same goal by introducing people to programming in a low-stakes, no experience required fashion. Countless other organizations, like Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code, and the Computer Science Teachers Association, have also sprung up to bridge the gap between the computer science workforce and primary school students.Despite all the excitement surrounding computer science education, not all states have high numbers of students learning computer science. Arkansas, in particular, is trailing behind others.\n\nAdvanced Placement classes teach curriculum designed by the College Board, and are offered to high school students as college-preparatory classes. Following completion of the course, students may take an optional AP Exam to demonstrate their mastery of the course content, and potentially earn college credit. While AP Computer Science is not the only way to learn computer science, participation in this curriculum provides a lens for analyzing the reach of computer science education. In Arkansas, there is a concerning lack of students who take the AP Computer Science exam compared to students taking other AP exams. In 2016, of the 47,415 Advanced Placement exams taken, only 0.64 percent of those — 304 tests — were for computer science. The most popular exam, AP English Language and Composition, had a 17.85 percent share with 8465 tests.\n\nDespite the dearth of Arkansas AP Computer science students, enrollment is growing. As the above graph shows, the number of students taking the exam has been climbing steadily, with a large spike between 2014 and 2015. The increasing enrollment is thanks to the state’s many efforts to improve access to computer science education. Recently, the state began to require all public high schools and public charter schools to offer at least one computer science class. The law went into effect for the 2015–2016 school year, which explains the sudden increase in the number of students taking the AP Computer Science exam. While enrolling in the AP Computer Science class is not necessary for taking the exam, the class is an important source of preparation for students who plan to take the exam. The increasing numbers of test takers is indicative of expanded access to computer science education.\n\nArkansas also meets all of Code.org’s state goals for promoting computer science education, which includes establishing a state plan, a dedicated position in the state department of education, and standards for classes; helping teachers learn computer science; and providing incentives for students to enroll in classes. All of these efforts have combined to drastically increase participation in AP Computer Science among Arkansas students.\n\nWhile enrollment may be growing, students’ scores remain low. The above graph shows the median score of AP Computer Science test takers. AP exams are graded on a scale of one to five, where scores three and above are considered passing. Scores in Arkansas have been consistently low, but have declined only slightly in recent years. It may be a good sign that the large increases in enrollment have not drastically lowered scores, meaning that the state’s resources are not strained even though there are more students taking the course. However, it is important to remember that 2016’s median score of 1.92, indicates a failing grade. While more students are taking the AP Computer Science Exam, this has not translated to increased content mastery. In order to truly expand access to computer science education, states like Arkansas must strive to provide quality education.\n\nTo reach its goal of expanding computer science education, Arkansas must now start investing in quality over quantity. Its existing laws can already help; for example, certifying teachers will help ensure teachers can teach the material properly and answer students’ questions competently. Furthermore, increased mentorship from professionals in the tech industry can also help ensure students can thoroughly learn the material. Currently, only one high school in Arkansas is part of the TEALS matching program, and expanding this program represents an opportunity to engage more students.\n\nComputer science education is becoming increasingly important as technology starts to intersect with more fields and becomes a more central part of society. In order to prepare future generations to substantively engage in this field, computer science education must not only be accessible to as many students as possible in every state, but must also include high-quality instruction and mentorship that ensures deep engagement, true learning, and effective content mastery.", "title": "Quality over Quantity: The New Challenge Facing Computer Science Education", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/quality-quantity-new-challenge-facing-computer-science-education/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-02 12:03:33-04:00", "authors": ["Jos Miguel Larios Villatoro"], "content": "War is often thought of as a foreign concept, one that does not ever reach American soil. But, there is a constant battle that America’s youth in destitution must face – violence. This violence exists as a duality – organized due to gangs and yet chaotic because not all violence is gang-related. Naturally, the American public demands safety for its next generation, especially in schools. Facing this demand, administrators and politicians must establish order through policing. Yet, this struggle is not over how to defeat a foreign foe, but over America’s future. Without special care, lives could be lost forever, not just by means of bullets, but through mass incarceration.\n\nThis raises a question with a complex answer: how much policing is needed for schools? Policing, in this context, not only includes the physical manifestation of policing – security officers and police – but also the policies that drive the framework of law enforcement. Within this massive landscape are two general camps: those who argue that policing has been ineffective and has been taken too far, and those who argue that the present form of policing is necessary and helpful. By exploring both sides of this debate, some semblance of an answer may be found. Indeed, both sides desire to help, and thus both offer their own solutions. Neither side can be neglected, because doing so would neglect America’s youth.\n\nThe Students’ Perspective\n\nThis question – how much policing is needed – might appear to have a straight-forward answer: more police must surely mean more security, and therefore a better learning environment. However, according to several high school graduates in New York, the situation is not so simple.\n\nThe HPR sat down with Miguel, a graduate of August Martin High School in Jamaica, Queens, New York, to talk about his experience with school policing. When Miguel was a high school student in the early 2000s, August Martin had the reputation of a “jail school” – a school where students were treated like inmates, and where there was a constant feeling of danger between students. Miguel recounted that in between classes, “the hallways would fill up… For those fifteen minutes, everything went down. You had drug deals, stabbings – it was so compact no one knows. You just see someone [stab] somebody up stupid fast and walk away… I once caught two kids [assaulting] a teacher.”\n\nThe August Martin administration and the New York State Board of Education were tasked with restoring order and constructing a safe learning environment within the school. They began by implementing airport-level security: bag checks, metal detectors, and pat downs. Due to the large presence of gang affiliations within the student population, certain gang-associated colors – red, blue, and gold – were banned from the school.\n\nBut Miguel recounted a sort of cycle which seemed to occur in response to new rules and increased security measures. Students would find ways to circumvent rules, the administration would establish new ones, and the cycle would repeat itself. “We later on had a rule that we couldn’t [open] up the windows… At times, people would come from the outside to our school, they would know what classroom someone was in… and they would just throw a blade [knife] or something through the window.” Despite the introduction of metal detectors and stricter rules, students always found ways to circumvent the system. Students would open back doors for gang members to assault specific students, often simply in response to minor verbal altercations. From Miguel’s account, and from those of other students in equally hazardous situations, it would appear that security in schools is often ineffective.\n\nHowever, some students’ views of policing in schools tell a different narrative. Hillcrest High School offers an interesting case study. The school was once considered one of the worst schools in New York City, facing myriad problems like gang violence and drug abuse. Since metal detectors and a large team of security personnel were introduced to Hillcrest, the school has made a comeback, even earning a National Blue Ribbon Award for its progress.\n\nSoraya Alli, a graduate of Hillcrest High School and current student at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told the HPR of her experience at Hillcrest: “The students from Hillcrest typically face some form of personal and financial circumstances, coming from low-income backgrounds.” According to numerous studies, low-income youth are exposed to violence at greater rates than their more affluent peers. The mental toll of this violence is immense; students from low-income backgrounds face high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.\n\nAlthough Alli’s High School was never as dangerous as August Martin High School, violence was still a common occurrence. But, she says it was the metal detectors and x-ray machines which made students feel safer. As she explained, “No guns or knives could be brought into the school.” Furthermore, because of a comprehensive security team, attendance seemed to have greatly improved. The “school security team and deans would do something called ‘sweeping,’ which was basically…getting them [the students] out of the halls and into a sort of detention room,” deterring students from skipping class.\n\nThere appears to be a conflict: in some of the worst schools in New York, increased policing did not resolve much, but in similar schools, it led to drastic improvements.\n\nSo, is increased policing the key to safer schools or not?\n\nThe Researchers’ Perspective\n\nResearchers have conducted studies on security programs like the ones implemented in Miguel and Alli’s schools. As a result of this research, metal detectors and x-ray machines have come under heavy scrutiny for their ineffectiveness at diminishing violence.\n\nOne study, conducted in Florida’s Miami-Dade County, found that in addition to the ease of bypassing metal detectors, there are additional drawbacks to their implementation, the most important of which is cost. As the study notes, “if funding sources for specialists to operate the metal detectors decrease or disappear, the entire security plan may become unworkable.” Since school funding is often cut in times of economic decline, it is difficult to rely on security teams as the central safety provider. This is especially problematic considering not all states’ formulas for the allocation of funds specifically target schools with the greatest student need. Thus, it is often the case that the schools which are most in-need of increased security cannot afford it.\n\nAnother study, conducted by the American School Health Association, found that metal detectors “do not reduce the risk of violent behavior.” Furthermore, they also “may detrimentally impact students’ perception of safety.” While, of course, metal detectors and the like do not negatively impact all students’ perception of safety, Alli’s testimony does bring up an interesting perspective on this issue: if students believe they are unsafe, then perhaps they will act as if they exist in an unsafe environment. Increased paranoia and distrust of peers and others can breed violence. At the very least, it is proven that decreased perceptions of safety lead to worse academic performance.\n\nBut to effectively understand, and change, the current state of policing in schools, it is vital to understand it at the policy level.\n\nZero Tolerance Policies\n\nThe most prevalent policy concerning security within schools is “Zero-Tolerance.” As defined by the American Psychology Association, it is “a philosophy or policy that mandates the application of predetermined consequences, most often severe and punitive in nature, that are intended to be applied regardless of the gravity of behavior, mitigating circumstances, or situational context.” Hence, the program is centered around providing zero tolerance to any transgression.\n\nProponents of the program argue that this policy benefits the school system. Because of its implementation, the community knows that the school is cracking down on “troublemakers.” In 2005, the American public supported this program overwhelmingly; 70% of teachers and 68% of parents supported the initiative so long as it specifically targeted troublemakers.” These rates did not dip drastically when the initiative was applied to smaller transgressions.\n\nBut it is difficult to say that the public remains as supportive of the zero tolerance policy. With the expansion of mass media via the internet, harsh outcomes come to light. In one case, a student was suspended for using a knife to slice an apple for a health project presentation in school. Many administrators have been vocal against zero tolerance, citing a more progressive approach as superior. Such an approach would involve more tolerance and collaboration between students, faculty, and security. For instance, programs like MyTeachingPartner have emphasized inclusionary practices. Instead of immediately disciplining students when they act out, this progressive approach advocates talking to students and emotionally connecting with them to prevent future transgressions.\n\nSuch progressive approaches have been notably promoted by Mo Canady, a former police officer of 25 years and the Executive Director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. Canady has been interviewed by multiple publications as a top expert in the field of public security in schools. When interviewed by “The Know It All” podcast, he said that what matters when it comes to improving school safety is training and “having the right person.” Many students in impoverished neighborhoods have faced trauma, as Soraya Alli accounted, and in Canady’s view, it takes patience to ameliorate such divisions.\n\nIn his “The Know It All” interview, Canady recounts one instance where there was a female student who was “throwing chairs” and was “really out of control.” As per zero tolerance policies in other school districts, this student would have been suspended. But, because of the compassion of the school resource officer who talked to her, the school discovered that she was being sexually assaulted by her mother’s boyfriend. According to Canady, because of the SRO’s training, a sexual predator was taken to justice and a “student received the help she needed.”\n\nSecuring America’s Future\n\nWith students, school administrators, members of the public all debating how to best prepare the next generation, the issue of school safety becomes controversial. Students living on the front lines of this debate vary in their view of security. But perhaps the main defining difference is the level of compassion each student received from their schools. Miguel saw police not as community figures, but as enforcers. Alli saw security as a mix of these two, and she witnessed some officers “abusing their power simply because they [had] it,” harassing students who were 45 seconds late to class, while others attempted to connect with students and build genuine relationships. As alluded to by Canady, it is perhaps this police–student connection that is most vital. Without this connection, policies like zero tolerance, and other mechanisms, like metal detectors, are not truly effective.\n\nSo perhaps the best way to police schools, according to research and experts, does not necessarily correlate with increasing the presence of police and metal detectors. Schools are the place in which America’s next generation learn not just arithmetic, but how to act and contribute in a society. Hence, compassion and community must be placed first, not just because they lead to safer schools, but because they lead to a more compassionate generation.\n\nImage Source: Flickr/neapr", "title": "Police in Schools: Securing America's Future", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/covers/covers-spring-2017/police-schools-securing-americas-future/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

According to the U.S. News and World Report, South Carolina and Nevada have some of the worst school systems in the United States, while Maryland and Massachusetts have some of the best. But the statistics from this year’s Advanced Placement tests show that the educational experiences of students who identify as African American are different from those who identify as white, regardless of school system quality.\n\nAdvanced Placement classes teach curriculum designed by the College Board, and are offered to high school students as college-preparatory classes. Following completion of the course, students may take an optional AP Exam to demonstrate their mastery of the course content, and potentially earn college credit. While AP classes are not the only way to provide advanced educational opportunities, participation in this curriculum provides a lens for analyzing racial equity in education. In many states, there is a concerning lack of black students participating in AP classes proportional to these students’ share of the population.\n\nThe graph above compares the U.S. Census’ estimates of percentage of state population identifying as black alone, with the percentage of students taking AP tests in each state who also identified their race as solely black. For example, in South Carolina, black students made up about 11 percent of AP test takers whereas almost 28 percent of the population is black.\n\nIf education equity were achieved, black students would take AP Tests at a rate proportional to their share of the population; however, in states like South Carolina and Nevada, black AP representation is about a third of the state population. Even in states like Maryland and Massachusetts, which are conventionally considered to have higher performing, better school systems, black students taking AP exams are still underrepresented by half.\n\nWhile average scores on AP tests are higher for both white and black students in states on the higher end of the school quality spectrum, this does not close the gap in minority representation among AP test takers. Even as schools in a state improve in quality, black students are continually left behind. Better education systems may have more total students taking AP tests, but while the raw numbers of black test takers increase, black representation continues to lag. School systems are working to improve and engage more students in advanced academics, but the representation gap between black and white students remains almost as wide as it ever was.\n\nMore concerning is that with good rankings comes a sense of complacency. A Google search for “Massachusetts education system” pulls up dozens of recent stories praising the state for its good results, but even states like Massachusetts with high-ranking education systems need to evaluate the representation of their black students in AP testing environments. These recent College Board statistics reveal that general improvement to state education systems does little to close the racial representation gap.

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-03-27 14:39:23-04:00", "authors": ["Nick Danby"], "content": "For an impressive 235 years, the Icelandic Police Force never killed a single citizen. That all changed on December 2, 2013, when Iceland’s law enforcement agency shot a crazed, unstable gunman. Shortly after the suspect was pronounced dead in his Reykjavik apartment, Icelandic police chief Haraldur Johannessen told reporters that the “police [regretted] the incident…and would like to extend their condolences to the family of the [gunman].” The police chief also emphasized that the officers had tried every means possible to subdue the man peacefully; using force only became necessary after he repeatedly fired his gun at the police—endangering neighbors and even hitting one policeman on the helmet.\n\nStatistics suggest that Iceland’s “violence is the last resort” conflict resolution policy works far better than America’s perceived “gun is always an option” policy. In all of Iceland’s history, still only one person has been killed by police. In America, one person is killed by the police every eight hours. While opponents of police reform have argued that the policy difference is warranted since Iceland has less crime and fewer guns, this assertion ignores the fact that there are approximately 90,000 firearms in Iceland, which is home to only 320,000 people.\n\nGuns are an important part of Icelandic culture, but they are also used to commit malicious crimes, just as they are in the United States. Furthermore, Iceland’s strategy of peaceful de-escalation and of limited reliance on firearms has been adopted by other countries like Britain, Spain, Norway, and Sweden—all of which have higher levels of crime than Iceland and still retain a low number of police shootings relative to the United States. With these results, a continued exoneration of America’s police ignorantly suggests that our criminals are just biologically more aggressive than our international counterparts. But such a response is erroneous. Rather, the main factors which contribute to police violence in the United States are a police applicant pool with low educational attainment levels, and limited training opportunities for current officers. All hope is not lost, however. Implementing the policies employed by some European countries can create a stronger, more trustworthy, and more effective American police force.\n\nA Cyclical Struggle\n\nThe nature of law enforcement is changing. With the development of new technology, crime and the way to solve it has become more complicated. To master these technologies while peacefully resolving increasingly tense situations in the field, current and future police officers need a well-rounded education. This type of education imparts both exceptional technical and social skills. As police recruitment falters in the United States, many recruiters are citing low pay, a deteriorating public image, and these increased education requirements as the principal deterrents for applicants. With an inability to raise salaries and no planned strategy to combat bad public relations, departments have decided to only target educational requirements by lowering them to increase applicant pools. A prime example is Seattle’s police department which responded to record-low recruitment numbers by decreasing education requirements. This strategy has been adopted nationally, and the change has resulted in only one percent of all local police departments requiring a four-year degree and only 15 percent requiring a two-year degree.\n\nIceland’s mandate for increased police education makes the country’s police force a complete opposite of America’s. Instead of decreasing requirements, the Icelandic parliament passed a bill in May 2016, to close the State Police Academy and bring a “police studies” curricula to the university level. Iceland’s example of creating a more enlightened social education for the police has been embraced by other European nations as well. In Norway, officers need a three-year bachelor’s degree to graduate, and police education has increasingly focused on classes in government and law, which discuss broader topics than basic law enforcement training. In Germany, entry into their “Mittlerer Dienst” (the middle service) requires at least 10 years of total schooling, in addition to two and a half years of police academy training.\n\nWith deadly weapons in the hands of more and more criminals, Iceland has done a good job of educating their police force to approach conflicts in analytical ways instead of purely aggressive ones. The most impressive statistics to arise from these heightened requirements are the amplified enrollment numbers. In Norway, over 5,000 applicants recently competed for 700 annual spots in the Norwegian police academy. In Germany’s Rhine-Westphalia force, 8,000 candidates vied for 1,640 open spots. A stronger focus on better-educated police officers, along with increased applicants, have allowed these departments to act with their head instead of their weapons. Consequently, police shootings have decreased or remained rare in these countries.\n\nEducation’s Virtue\n\nEurope’s proven success in increased officer education could end up being the American police’s saving grace for higher recruitment numbers. If European nations are both increasing standards and applicant numbers, it indicates that these standards are not what is deterring police applicants. These results, in addition to parallel salaries between the United States and Europe, suggest that the police’s public image might be a contributing factor to their recruitment woes. Germany’s Rhine-Westphalia police department’s focus on higher educational attainment was reasoned the “best practice” for police departments and their public image, according to the RAND Corporation and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance. This higher attainment has the potential to also benefit American police departments.\n\nIncreased police shootings and a trend toward police militarization have sparked rioting and heavy criticism from both public officials and the media. This deterioration of the police’s public image in America has deterred countless potential applicants from applying. One prominent example is in Ferguson, Missouri, which has suffered low police recruitment numbers since the death of Michael Brown.\n\nThe trend toward militarization can be stagnated, however, by a more educated police force. A recent analysis of disciplinary cases against Florida cops found that officers with only a high school education were the subject of 75 percent of all disciplinary actions, while four-year degree officers accounted for only 11 percent of such actions. Police departments across America have asked for innovative officers who have fewer administrative problems and who de-escalate conflicts—all of which contributes to a better public image. If departments truly want these types of applicants, they would be benefit from following European policies of centralizing national standards and requiring a college degree. This has the potential to allow more thoughtful and less aggressive candidates from usurping the applicant pool and tainting the police force.\n\nPractice Makes Perfect\n\nSuccessful police departments are a product of not just improved education, but also specialized training. When foreigners gasp at the low rates of crime and police shootings in European nations, they may want to consider how these crime rates are the result of better police training.\n\nEuropeans achieve responsible policing by first centralizing their police standards, which ensures that every police department and academy teaches the same material. In the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland, after receiving some form of postsecondary education, the government requires police attend a national police academy for three years to learn this centralized material. In Germany, the process takes at least 130 weeks—more than two full years of preparation. European training is longer because the departments deem it necessary to give officers an all-inclusive and thorough police training to practice communicating with emotionally disturbed individuals and to approach various scenarios through the lens of conflict resolution, rather than one of violence.\n\nDespite the United States’ heavy reliance on police, America has one of the most untrained police forces in the Western world. In North Carolina, it takes 1,528 hours to become a licensed barber; to be a police officer it only takes 620. In Louisiana, police need only 360 hours of training, while licensed manicurists need no fewer than 500 hours. While we can all feel safe visiting a North Carolina barber or Louisiana manicurist, being properly protected by law enforcement in those states is not guaranteed. These disturbing numbers aren’t just reserved to a couple of states either. The average American police training lasts only 19 weeks. This rushed mode of training is inextricably linked to the disorganized and overly gun-reliant local American police forces. Professor Peter Kraska at Eastern Kentucky University showed that 80 percent of police paramilitary deployments were for “proactive” applicants—meaning instances of police-initiated violence, not in response to civilian violence. These deployments are employed by local police departments who don’t have the resources to appropriately respond to threats. As a result, Kraska has recorded 275 instances of “seriously botched” SWAT raids on private homes, many of which resulted in innocent civilians being killed.\n\nWhile it is noteworthy that some American police departments prioritize de-escalation, these disjointed and decentralized police standards have led to the evolution of two types of police departments: those focusing on militarized force and those focusing on peaceful de-escalation. The former is primarily responsible for the increase in police shootings; the latter are departments who adhere to more European principles.\n\nThe former of the two departments is the problem. In the year 2016, the number of fatal police shootings in the United States has totaled a record 963. Countless police officers and politicians have defended these high numbers by blaming the American people’s aggression or the multitude of guns in our country. Most of these opponents use this reasoning to justify not increasing police training. But knife violence in England is a major issue despite British police only killing one person with a knife since 2013. In America, knives aren’t a major tool for violence, but our police have killed more than 575 people wielding knives since 2013. The weapons aren’t the problem, police training is.\n\nExhaust All Options\n\nThe sufficient time the European police use for training fosters a culture that minimizes violence and prioritizes the protection of all citizens, including alleged criminals. For the Europeans, this training supports their most crucial policy: the gun is only a last resort. In Spain, training requires that officers always fire a warning shot and aim for non-vital body parts before ever considering a lethal action; in Finland, training stresses that officers need to get permission from a superior officer before shooting. Without these centralized initiatives, many American police departments follow a path of militarization by focusing on how to protect themselves and their fellow officers, rather than the citizens they are bound to defend. This is demonstrated when the typical American police recruit will spend 58 hours trained on how to use a gun, but only eight hours learning the department’s use of force policy. This difference in police training correlates with use of force in practice.\n\nPolice departments should not have to choose between training their officers in either peace or force—both should be taught extensively. To best serve the people, American police need to know how to properly use force to protect themselves, and they should be equipped to resolve conflicts without the tools in their gun belts. These departments need to follow Europe’s example of uniting behind a centralized policy of de-escalation rather than militarization. These departments also need a policy that focuses on comprehensive training that includes working with emotionally or mentally ill people, and resolving situations peacefully. Such changes will finally begin a shift in American policing from the current “shoot first” policy to Europe’s “think before you shoot” mindset. Peaceful outcomes are not just reserved for Europe; they can happen here, too.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Flickr/thomashawk", "title": "Lessons from Inspector Clouseau: What America’s Police Can Learn from Europe", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/online/lessons-inspector-clouseau-americas-police-can-learn-european-nations/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}
{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-03-24 12:46:18-04:00", "authors": ["Drew Pendergrass"], "content": "Katharine Hayhoe is a Texan, an evangelical Christian, and a climate scientist. She’s on a mission to convince skeptics, many of whom share her faith, that climate change is not a liberal hoax. “Global Weirding,” a PBS-produced web series that Hayhoe hosts, addresses everything from climate science to the Bible, arguing among other things that Christians should take a stand on climate change. That, in part, explains the death threats.\n\nBut even before her show started, Hayhoe was the target of a cottage industry of climate skeptics. She came to prominence in early 2012, after then-presidential candidate Newt Gingrich suddenly dropped her chapter from a book he was editing about the environment—Hayhoe’s arguments affirming climate change caught the fury of Rush Limbaugh at the height of the Republican primaries.\n\nThat was when the Freedom of Information Act inquiries began. The conservative American Tradition Institute sent a FOIA to Texas Tech, where Hayhoe is a professor, requesting her email correspondence with specified journalists. She was also asked to turn over emails with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an organization that defends climate scientists. “When you write a FOIA, it’s just a simple request,” Hayhoe told the HPR. “But the FOIAs I got were more like an arrest warrant.”\n\nHayhoe, like many scientists who are subject to similar inquiries, thinks the group was looking for embarrassing emails to use in political debate. “Their MO is you’re guilty, and you can never be proven innocent,” she said. “You have to scrutinize your thoughts before you express them [in email], because people will take one phrase, not even one sentence, completely out of context.”\n\n“People can get very dogged in attacking climate scientists, and they can do things you would never think of,” Lauren Kurtz said in an interview with the HPR. She’s the director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, based out of Columbia University, which defends scientists like Hayhoe from legal attacks.\n\nNational FOIA legislation was signed by President Johnson in 1966, and similar FOIA laws are in place in all 50 states. These laws were passed to hold government agencies and officials accountable. But to some climate scientists, politically-motivated FOIA inquiries don’t do anything to increase transparency. Instead, they undermine scientists’ ability to do work.\n\n“If I took a job somewhere else in Texas, I’m not interested in a job at another public university,” says Hayhoe. “I’m only interested in jobs at private universities now, because there’s a different standard over what’s released. It takes a huge amount of time to comb through your emails to find everything.”\n\nClimate scientists across the spectrum are subject to aggressive legal inquiry, personal attacks, and physical threats. Climate change has entered the mainstream of national political debates—yet another divide between Democrats and Republicans—and support or denial of climate science has become another part of the party line. As a result, actual science is pushed to the side.\n\nA Political Litmus Test\n\nOn July 28, 2003, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R – Okla.) took to the Senate floor to give a speech entitled “The Science of Climate Change.” He concludes with the thundering lines, “Wake up, America. With all the hysteria, all the fear, all the phony science, could it be that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? I believe it is.”\n\nInhofe, who has received $465,000 from the oil and gas industry since 2011, is one of the strongest Republican opponents of climate science in Congress. Along with Representative Lamar Smith (R – Tex.), chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Inhofe is setting the standard for conservative views on the subject.\n\n“Climate change has become a litmus test issue of political identity,” said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&M, in an interview with the HPR. “A Republican’s greatest weakness is a primary challenge from the right. You can’t deviate from the party norm. And that’s why, if you look around, you see a lot of reasonable Republicans, but they’re all out of office.”\n\nDessler believes that growing partisanship around climate change has led to debates that are no longer rooted in science. “You have these people, and if they show any deviation from the party line, they’ll get their head handed to them,” he said. “And you have people on the other side who are in basically the same situation.”\n\nIn 2012, Dessler received FOIA inquiries from the same group as Hayhoe. Although Dessler is adamant that he supports open records laws, and that it is relatively easy for him to respond to FOIA requests, he still finds these sorts of inquiries questionable. “When I write a paper, all of the information is in there. You can see exactly how I got to my conclusion,” Dessler said. “Clearly these open records request for science are done to find something embarrassing.”\n\n“People don’t understand the process of peer review,” Hayhoe said. “If it’s peer reviewed, not only does that mean it’s in the public domain, it also means we have described what we have done in sufficient detail that anyone could reproduce what we did.” Emails, then, should reveal nothing of scientific importance.\n\nFor politicians on both sides of the aisle, however, investigations into climate scientists serve to reinforce their reputation. In 2015, the University of Alabama in Huntsville received a letter from Representative Raul Grijalva (D – Ariz.), asking for sweeping information about John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science and a prominent climate skeptic. “They had the view that if you had our type of information, you had to be paid under the table,” Christy told the HPR. Christy’s funding, by all reports, comes from state and federal sources.\n\n“These kinds of personal and political attacks are terrible no matter who they’re directed towards,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT, told the HPR. Emanuel is open about his disagreement with Christy—they’ve represented opposite sides in climate debates—but scientists seem largely united in their dislike of nonscientific tactics to discredit peer reviewed research. “There’s no better way to stop someone from doing whatever it is they do than to flood them with FOIA requests,” he said.\n\nBehind the Attacks\n\n“The wrath that’s being directed at climate scientists at root is not because people don’t respect the science or the scientists,” says Emanuel. “It is expressing a fear of what the solution to the problem might look like.” There is considerable anxiety among Republicans that climate change will undermine small-government conservatism. This leads think tanks and other groups to harass scientists, even if they don’t have backing from vested interests like the fossil fuel industry. The issue has moved beyond economics into a proxy war over ideology.\n\nIn 2015, Smith launched an investigation of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Kathryn Sullivan, alleging that NOAA scientists altered climate data in a landmark climate change study. Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator during President Obama’s second term, recalled the time as particularly contentious. “[Smith] handled himself in a very aggressive way,” McCarthy told the HPR. “It was very clear from the way he approached it that what he didn’t like was not the science, but the outcome of the science.”\n\nSmith, who has received $95,050 from the oil and gas industry since 2015, keeps his investigations legal. Other skeptics have taken more extreme steps to discredit climate scientists.\n\nIn November 2009, a Climatic Research Unit server at the University of East Anglia was hacked. Hundreds of emails and other private documents from notable climate scientists were leaked online. The leak, dubbed “Climategate,” was seen by many skeptics as evidence that climate scientists doctored data. One email in particular caught their eye. It read, in part: “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie, from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”\n\nMichael Mann, the “Mike” from the email and the Director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, explains in his book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars that the sentence was taken out of context: “In reality, neither ‘trick’ nor ‘hide the decline’ was referring to recent warming, but rather the far more mundane issue of how to compare proxy and instrumental temperature records.” According to Mann and other scientists, “trick” simply refers to a clever approach to solving a problem.\n\nAfter Climategate, Mann was subject to a congressional investigation, two independent inquiries from Penn State, EPA petitions, and a detailed investigation from the National Science Foundation. All found him innocent of any wrongdoing.\n\nAlthough Climategate revealed that scientists needed to be more open with their data, it also exposed the extent to which the field had become politicized. It is true that environmental groups have some influence over politicians on the left, and that the fossil fuel industry has considerable lobbying power over the right. However, vested interests alone fail to explain the level of fury in political debate over climate science.\n\nWhen illegal practices like email hacking become common, it reveals that more fundamental issues are at stake. A whopping 97 percent of climate scientists agree the Earth is warming as a result of human activity. Politicians are not inherently anti-science; instead, attempts to discredit climate scientists have become a tool to justify a particular small-government ideology. In the proxy war, that ideology matters more than science. “These are just ridiculous arguments that have moved on from what’s actually right,” says Dessler.\n\nLetting Scientists do Science\n\nAfter Climategate, Mann’s troubles had just begun. The attorney general of Virginia used the scandal as a launching point for a civil investigation of Mann’s use of taxpayer money when he was still a professor at the University of Virginia. These attacks were so serious and expensive that a new group was founded in 2011 to help support his defense: The Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, now directed by Kurtz.\n\n“At the time, a bunch of climate scientists were dealing with various lawsuits, the most prominent of which was Dr. Michael Mann,” said Kurtz. “Ken Cuccinelli, who was the attorney general [of Virginia], claimed that Michael Mann’s research was tantamount to fraud on taxpayers.” Eventually, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled in Mann’s favor.\n\nMcCarthy is vocal about her support of Mann, but also defended John Christy’s research. To her, personal attacks on any scientist are harmful to climate research. “[These attacks] are really an attempt to silence a discussion that democracy relies on,” McCarthy said. “Scientists do disagree. I do not know any scientific exploration where there are not people who hold differing opinions.”\n\nHowever, when it comes to crafting regulation, McCarthy assumes the scientific consensus. “Governance is not about getting unanimity of opinion. It’s about looking at the strength of the arguments,” she said. Policy, as McCarthy stresses, is different from science.\n\nMeanwhile, science continues to come under attack. Last year, Malcolm Hughes, one of Mann’s colleagues, testified before an an Arizona trial court that repeated investigations have harmed his career: “I have been directly informed by several colleagues that they have limited their email communications with me because I have been targeted in public records requests,” he says. “This chilling effect is not merely theoretical but rather an actual and present harm.”\n\nPolitics is a question of philosophy. Because philosophy is grounded in deep, unanswerable questions—how do we govern ourselves? How do we maximize our freedom while preserving justice?—there is no definitive way to prove one political view is objectively correct. There are only arguments and counterarguments.\n\nIn the political sphere, science simply becomes another kind of argument. Some conservatives see climate science as a threat to limited government, so instinctively they make a counterargument. The actual science is an inconvenience, a weak point in the argument that can be covered up by quoting embarrassing emails. In the world of politics, scientists matter not because of their commitment to discovery, but because of their role as cannon fodder.\n\nImage Credit: Gage Skidmore/Flickr", "title": "Inside the Climate Science Witch Hunts", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/culture/inside-the-climate-science-witch-hunts/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-04 14:16:24-04:00", "authors": ["Malvika Menon"], "content": "The Russian populace demonstrated a rare show of dissent in late March, gathering in various cities in large numbers for anti-government protests. With 20,000 people in Moscow, 10,000 in St. Petersburg, and 2,000 in Novosibirsk, the protests were large in both scale and scope. However, the large turnout translated into chaos, as even the leader of the protests, Alexei Navalny, admitted that he could no longer recognize the demonstration he originally organized. The government detained Navalny and over 600 other protestors, but according to human rights groups, it is likely that this large number of arrests is actually understated. In the era of Putin, such powerful dissent is uncharacteristic. Given the risk of punitive actions that were announced prior to the demonstration, this large turnout is truly intriguing.\n\nA vocal anti-corruption and anti-Putin politician, these protests are not the first time that Navalny has sparred with the government. With a background in the legal and financial sectors, Navalny first became widely known to the public in 2009 via his blog, which served as an outlet to organize political movements criticizing Putin and his allies. His criticism of Putin and corruption resonated among those similarly dissatisfied with Putin’s authoritarian ways, hence allowing Navalny’s foray into Russian politics.\n\nNavalny’s penchant for demonstrations can be traced back to his involvement in the 2011-2012 anti-Kremlin protests. Since then, his calls for Russians to actively and vocally protest Putin have apparently rung loud and clear, as Monday’s vast showing indicates. However, his political career has been hindered by his numerous arrests by the Russian authorities for charges ranging from embezzlement to fraud. These allegations, however, have been classified as political arrests by organizations such as the Memorial Human Rights Center, and , Navalny has largely retained his supporters. Undeterred by political intimidation and a failed run in the 2013 Moscow mayoral election, Navalny has continued to take the media and the Russian public by storm, and aims to run against Putin in next year’s presidential election.\n\nAlthough Navalny’s fifteen-day detention and the large crackdown on the protests following Monday’s demonstration have raised questions regarding his political career and the durability of his anti-Putin movement,If history is any indication, one more arrest will not deter Navalny from his vocal and politically potent role in Russian politics. Moreover, Putin and his allies may be limited in the severity of punishments they can inflict upon Navalny, owing to his prominence in the public eye.\n\nIf Putin seeks a more serious punishment than a temporary detainment for Navalny, Navalny’s supporters—and more generally, the Russian public—will likely be emboldened to take to the streets again on a larger scale. It is likely that Putin and his allies will continue to tread lightly around the issue of Navalny to minimize public dissatisfaction and keep him in the running for the upcoming presidential election to at least maintain the facade of fair elections to both citizens and a global audience. As long as Navalny remains at the helm of these movements, their popularity and prevalence is likely assured, due to his effective rhetoric and public appeal.\n\nHowever, in the case that Navalny does back down in the face of further punishment by Putin, the lifespan of these anti-Putin and anti-corruption movements becomes much more uncertain and difficult to predict. While the public’s energy and sentiment may be strong enough to sustain the movement for a while, with no clear replacement available, removing Navalny could lead to a leadership vacuum, potentially fatal to the movement and its effectiveness.\n\nThat said, it seems there is a high probability that Navalny will continue his vocal opposition to the Putin government, and with Navalny at the helm it’s likely these anti-government demonstrations will last a while. Setting aside Navalny’s presence, it is clear that the current sociopolitical situation plays a large role in these protests. Concern about Putin’s authoritarian style of governance and his government’s corrupt ways will continue to grow unless given some outlet. Thus, despite the authorities’ crackdown on this set of demonstrations, the timeliness of this public dissent, combined with the powerful voice of Navalny, make the incidence of further protests in the near future highly plausible. Unless Putin’s self-serving regime can give the Russian public something in the way of real progress, it will continue to make its voice heard.\n\nImage Credit: Wikimedia Commons/ Evgeny Feldman/Novaya Gazeta", "title": "Uncharacteristic Unrest: The Russian Public’s Protests of Putin", "url": "http://harvardpolitics.com/world/uncharacteristic-unrest-russian-publics-protests-putin/", "main": "http://harvardpolitics.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

But there was an issue concerning cyber security experts and computers scientists much more damning than any of the secretive information featured in the new leaks: the C.I.A.'s total disregard of safety measures put in place for discovering these dangerous flaws in smart gadgets.\n\nThe federal agency has kept its discovery of many exploits (software tools targeting flaws in products, typically used for malicious hacking purposes) a secret, \"stockpiling\" that information rather than reporting it to multinational corporations, throwing millions of Americans into the crosshairs of a dangerous, intergovernmental spying game in the process.\n\nRead: Wikipedia Vault 7 Leaks Effect: FBI Director Comey Says 'There Is No Such Thing As Absolute Privacy In America'\n\nThe CIA's lack of following protocol should be what's most alarming to the general public concerning the recent data dump, several national and cyber security experts recently told International Business Times.\n\n\"What's critical to understand is that these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world, and that's deeply troubling,\" Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney working on the civil rights group’s national security project, told IBT. \"Our government should be working to help the companies patch vulnerabilities when they are discovered, not stockpiling them.\"\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nThe C.I.A. knew its own classified documents had been floating around the dark web for at least a year and was well aware the hacking capabilities it was using to break into everyday tech could also have been employed by hostile foreign networks. Russian President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin reportedly orchestrated a sprawling governmental operation in an attempt to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which featured several cyber attacks on email servers and devices used by members of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe C.I.A.'s lack of a heads-up to corporations impacted by the exploits was seen as more damning than government operations like \"Weeping Angel\" – a spying technique using Samsung smart TVs that caused the devices to appear in off mode while secretly recording information and relaying it to the federal agency.\n\nThe government enacted the Vulnerabilities Equities Process to reduce the unnecessary stockpiling of exploits. The procedure was meant to provide guidelines for agencies like the C.I.A. for notifying companies when dangerous issues are discovered in their devices. The measure was put in place during the Obama administration to prevent cyber attacks from terrorist networks and foreign governments, including Russia and China.\n\nBut the C.I.A. completely ignored the Vulnerabilities Equity Process, instead exploring ways to use exploits for their own purposes, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an international non-profit digital rights group that reviewed a copy of the practice after filing a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\n\"It appears the CIA didn't even use the [Vulnerabilities Equity Process],\" Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told IBT. \"That’s worrisome, because we know these agencies overvalue their offensive capabilities and undervalue the risk to the rest of us.\"\n\nThe CIA said it refuses to comment on any purported confidential documents but defended its use of exploits in common products by way of a press release following WikiLeaks' initial data dump earlier this month. The agency said it wasn’t using the tools to target U.S. citizens but instead to \"aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nations states and other adversaries.\"\n\nThe agency may have left millions open to the exact attacks it said it was trying to prevent, regardless of its intentions, by not reporting those flaws to major companies, Justin Cappos, a professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University and cyber security expert whose created digital privacy software, told IBT.\n\n\"Now those blueprints are out there for hackers around the world, for anyone who wants to access this information and use it to compromise all these products,\" Cappos said. \"You have to ask yourself: If the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\"\n\nIf one thing was clear through WikiLeaks’ latest release, it's that flaws in technology will always exist, while actors – including the U.S. government – continue to learn of more ways to use them as tools for digital espionage. Digital privacy advocates say the tides will only begin to turn when consumers begin demanding a basic threshold of online security from companies and their governments.\n\nWhen asked how to describe the thousands of pages of complex data and its implications for typical Americans, Cohn offered a real world scenario.\n\n\"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed,\" Cohn said.\n\nBut the federal agency doesn't appear to be helping Americans protect themselves from intrusion. Instead, the C.I.A. was building secret tunnels, discovering other ways to break into their homes and not telling them about their broken locks.\n\n\"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock,\" Cohn continued. \"Stripped of the digital trappings, that is what happened here.\"", "title": "Is Privacy Real?

But that didn't happen and earlier this month the agency said it was drafting a request to ask the public for more data in order to do a cost-benefit analysis of the proposal.\n\nIndustry heavyweights and advisers who attended The John C. Bogle Legacy Forum on Tuesday at the Museum of American Finance said that even if the agency manages to finish its analysis and come up with a proposal in the next few months, they do not expect an actual rule to come about this year. Some observers now believe the rule might never come to fruition.\n\nI don't think you will see a rule before the presidential elections, said Harvey Pitt, chief executive of global business consulting firm Kalorama Partners LLC and a former SEC chairman, in an interview with Reuters at the forum.\n\nIf President Barack Obama wins a second term and Republicans keep control the House of Representatives, partisan fighting could further delay a final rule, Pitt said.\n\nThe proposal's genesis stems from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which required the SEC to study whether there should be a uniform fiduciary standard for advisers and brokers. The study, which was released almost a year ago, recommended a uniform standard.\n\nCurrently financial advisers are held to a fiduciary standard, which means their recommendations must be in the best interest in their clients. Brokers are held to a suitability standard, meaning that any products they recommend must be suitable for their clients, though the products need not be in their best interest.\n\nSome industry officials say they are glad to see the agency taking its time with the proposal given the complexities around it, including how to enforce it and how far-reaching it should be.\n\nThis is a really difficult issue that the SEC has to address, said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., chairman of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, in a panel discussion at the forum.\n\nSIFMA favors a uniform fiduciary standard but wants it to be nuanced in order to address the different business models used in the financial advice industry. We need to recognize that business is done differently for a small independent financial advisory shop, compared to one of these large firms (with) a very different business model.\n\nRyan and others say they hope that the latest delay could be good for another reason. It could prompt the SEC to work closely with the Department of Labor, which is working on its own standard of fiduciary care for advisers serving retirement plans. We have multiple fiduciary standards floating around, Ryan said.\n\nAn SEC spokesman said the proposal remains a priority for the staff but that the agency has not determined when it will be finalized.\n\nA number of attendees at the forum told Reuters that they would be surprised if a final rule ever gets enacted. Companies have a multitude of perspectives on the proposal and there is almost no consensus among them.\n\nThe structure of so many firms require them to push certain products, said Guy G. Rutherfurd Jr., a partner and portfolio manager with F&V Capital Management LLC, a registered investment adviser attending the forum. These firms do not want to see a uniform standard, he said.\n\nWall Street companies do not want to change their way of doing business and will continue to fight any rule that forces them to do so, said Michael Zeuner, senior executive partner at GenSpring Family Offices. Last summer Zeuner helped found The Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, an group designed to raise awareness around the need for a uniform fiduciary standard. But he's not hopeful a rule will ever be presented.\n\nI don't think Washington is going to do what is necessary, Zeuner said.

But when it comes to education, Schwarzman says more money is not necessarily a fix for ailing American public schools.\n\nSpeaking Friday at a World Economic Forum event called “Business Backs Education,” the Blackstone Group CEO was asked by International Business Times if he supports raising more money for education through President Barack Obama’s new proposal to increase capital gains taxes or through other proposals to end special “carried interest” tax exemptions for Wall Street financiers.\n\nHe declined to answer that question and instead suggested that a focus on resources is misguided.\n\nPhoto: David Sirota/International Business Times\n\n“In the Catholic schools they spend much less money than the public schools, and they get amazing results. Private schools spend much more money than the public schools and they get remarkable results,” said Schwarzman, who was once rumored to have likened tax increases to Hitler invading Poland.\n\n“So as an analyst, this can’t be just about money because you keep having great outcomes regardless of that. And so I would suggest that there are a lot of ways to be successful in education. It's usually good to have more resources of all types, but you can make due with a lot less and have great outcomes in large scale.”\n\nDespite the financial industry arguing that high pay on Wall Street is needed to retain and develop talent, Schwarzman suggested a potential solution for America education challenges could be unpaid labor.\n\n“I’ve always wondered, what you do in a society with people who just retire,” he told conference attendees. “If you could get those people, like a board, [to be an] unpaid workforce, pay them next to nothing or nothing, and have them go into the school system to be mentors to kids, and be an example of a certain type of success that you would get dramatically different outcomes. If you can get unemployed people that cost nothing, that can have this dramatic difference, that costs nothing. I love things that cost nothing that have great results. Imagine if you laid on technology and other types of things, you could really set the world on fire with this type of stuff.”\n\nSchwarzman touted Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s efforts to let religious groups run unpaid student mentorship programs in public schools. Kasich has moved to make extra education funding contingent on schools supporting those programs, a move the American Civil Liberties Union says might be unconstitutional.\n\nSchwarzman's views run counter to those of other analysts. A study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research this month suggested otherwise, showing a strong link between education funding and education and economic outcomes. Based on almost five decades of data, the researchers found a 10 percent increase in per-student spending leads to more completed years of education, higher wages and a reduction in the incidence of adult poverty. Those results, concluded the study, are even “more pronounced for children from low-income families.”\n\nSchwarzman's firm recently touted its investment in an expanding private education company.

Yet his expected selection to oversee the nation’s drug laws is a congressman from an opioid-ravaged district whose signature legislative accomplishment is a bill that shielded prescription opioid distributors from law enforcement scrutiny.\n\nThe White House is expected to name Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa, to be the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) — a position often referred to as the nation’s “drug czar.” Marino is a former prosecutor who has represented a rural district in northeastern Pennsylvania since 2011. The ONDCP declined to comment for this story and Marino’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment as well.\n\nRead: Ohio Opioid Epidemic: 13-Year-Old Boy Dies Of Heroin Overdose\n\nIf appointed, Marino would be the first member of Congress to become drug czar. He would come to the job after pulling in big money from an industry that is producing and distributing the nation’s most deadly legal drugs. Marino has received more than $150,000 in donations from the pharmaceutical industry in his political career, including $71,000 for the 2016 election, according to records at Maplight.org and Opensecrets.org. The data show Marino has received more money from the pharmaceutical industry than any other sector.\n\nAs the nation faces an opioid crisis fueled by the mass production and marketing of addictive prescription drugs, some physicians fighting the epidemic view Marino’s possible ascent to drug czar as a betrayal of rural communities ravaged by opioids — many of which voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump.\n\n“This is the opposite of draining the swamp,” Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of Opioid Policy Research at Brandeis University and co-founder of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing (PROP), told International Business Times. “In the midst of a public health crisis [Trump] is putting at the helm of the ONDCP someone who has worked for the opioid lobby against efforts to bring the epidemic under control.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how deadly the opioid epidemic has been for Americans. Since 1999, the number of overdose deaths from opioids has quadrupled, as did deaths from prescription opioids like oxycontin, fentanyl and hydrocodone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many experts blame this rise on the makers of opioid prescription drugs, like Purdue Pharma, the creator of oxycontin, which pled guilty to misleading doctors about the drug’s addictiveness and agreed to pay $600 million in fines in 2007. Three Purdue executives also agreed to pay a total of $34.5 million in fines.\n\n“This epidemic was created by pharmaceutical companies,” Georgetown University’s Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman told IBT. She is the director of PharmedOut, a group that advocates for responsible prescribing practices. “That’s not too strong to say.”\n\nThe epidemic has only intensified since Purdue’s guilty plea in 2007, and now cities and counties are bringing lawsuits against drug distributors — the companies that sell drugs wholesale. The three largest distributors — McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, which together generated $430 billion in 2015 and account for 85 percent of the drug distribution market — have agreed to pay $230 million in fines to the federal government and opioid-plagued West Virginia since late December. The fines were connected to charges that the companies failed to report suspicious orders of pharmaceuticals.\n\nAccording to Maplight.org, all three companies have given multiple campaign donations, totaling between $13,000 and $15,000, each to Marino who wrote legislation that made it harder for the DEA to take companies off a registry that allows them to distribute controlled substances. If the companies were dealt this penalty, they could potentially incur a far greater financial hit than fines.\n\nMarino introduced three versions of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act between 2014 and 2015 before H.R. 471 passed the House. In the Senate, Orrin Hatch, R-Ut, who received more money from the pharmaceutical industry than anyone in Congress between 2010 and 2016, introduced a companion bill. The legislation was eventually signed by President Barack Obama last year, but not before DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph Rannazzisi had a conversation with congressional staffers that provoked the ire of Marino, who said Rannazzisi told staffers the bill’s sponsors were “supporting criminals.” (Rannazzisi told the Washington Post he said the bill would “protect defendants in our cases.”)\n\nDuring a congressional hearing, Marino told Rannazzisi’s boss the comments offended him “immensely,” and the congressman even asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Rannazzisi had tried to “intimidate” members of Congress. Rannazzisi was eventually replaced at the DEA in 2015 and retired shortly after. He did not reply to multiple requests for comment for this story.\n\n“Rep. Marino has made it very clear he is on the side of opioid manufacturers,” PharmedOut’s Fugh-Berman told IBT. “The bill he supported made it hard for the DEA to go after distributors and wholesalers of drugs. The DEA was having its hands tied even before Trump got into office but this appointment will make things much worse.”\n\nIt could also put Marino in tension with others in the Trump administration. Late March, Trump convened the first meeting of the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis at the White House. The commission is led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has dedicated the last year of his increasingly unpopular governorship to fighting the opioid crisis, and who governs a state that is home to 14 of the world’s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies.\n\nPhoto: REUTERS/BRIAN C. FRANK\n\nTough On Marijuana\n\nAs drug czar, Marino’s job would be to coordinate drug policy across a variety of unrelated federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department (which houses the DEA), Health and Human Services and the Department of Education, according to former drug czar Gil Kerlikowske.\n\n”The job is “breaking down silos” and bringing together “all of those assets, so they can coalesce around a mission,” Kerlikowske, who served as drug czar under Obama from 2009 to 2014 before becoming the U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told IBT. “You also have the bully pulpit of being part of the White House.”\n\nKerlikowske was the chief of Seattle Police before taking the job, but didn’t think the czar should necessarily come from a law enforcement background.\n\n“Coming from Congress, I think that’s healthy, and probably a good idea,” Kerlikowske said. He also added that Marino’s history as a prosecutor would be an advantage, because it would be “pretty hard to cast him in the light of being soft on drugs.”\n\nWhile Marino has helped the opioid industry during his career in Congress, he has not been as friendly to the marijuana industry.\n\nMarino voted against allowing Veterans Administration doctors to prescribe medicinal marijuana to veterans in states where the drug is legal, and also voted against lowering obstacles to the production of hemp, the non-psychoactive part of the cannabis plant. He even voted against legislation that prevented the Justice Department from pursuing medical marijuana businesses that were legal under state law.\n\nThis tough-on-marijuana view aligns Marino with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has said marijuana is only “slightly less awful” than heroin and has sparked concerns about a return to the “War on Drugs” policies of the past. But while the Trump administration has signaled a tough stance on marijuana with its drug czar and attorney general picks — in spite of the fact a majority of Americans support legalizing the drug — it has simultaneously shown a deference to the pharmaceutical industry. Trump’s nominee to head the FDA is Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who has advocated for deregulation in the medical industry and received over $400,000 from pharmaceutical and medical device companies between 2013 and 2015, according to ProPublica.\n\nControversial End To Prosecutorial Career\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Marino could face questions about his law enforcement record — and a scandal that nearly ended his political career.\n\nIn 2007, Marino resigned from his position as a federal prosecutor after it was revealed Pennsylvania casino owner Louis DeNaples put down Marino’s name as a reference on a gaming application at the same time Marino’s office was investigating DeNaples for ties to organized crime. After his resignation, Marino went to work as in-house counsel for several DeNaples businesses. In 2010, during his first run for Congress, Allentown’s Morning Call reported Marino’s resignation came as he was being investigated by the Justice Department for his ties to DeNaples. The investigation was closed when Marino resigned, the report said.\n\nIn spite of that news, which broke just a month before election, Marino won his first term by nine percentage points over Democratic incumbent Chris Carney. The margin of victory grew to over 40 points in Marino’s election win in 2016.\n\nIt’s likely any special election held for Marino’s vacant seat will be won by a Republican. In Lycoming County, Trump trounced Hillary Clinton, getting 69 percent of the vote to the Democratic candidate's 25 percent. That same county saw an 80 increase in drug overdose deaths between 2014 and 2015, according to the DEA. The story is the same in many places throughout the country.\n\n“Many people in regions of the country hit very hard by the opioid addiction epidemic voted for Trump,” Kolodny said. “To the extent that many of them voted for Trump because they felt Obama failed on the opioid addiction epidemic… I expect they will be very upset by this choice.”", "title": "Trump’s Pick For Drug Czar Hauled In Thousands Of Dollars From Drug Distributors He Wrote Bill To Protect", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/trumps-pick-drug-czar-hauled-thousands-dollars-drug-distributors-he-wrote-bill", "main": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

(The bank, it should be noted, made an unusually low $960 million in consumer mortgage banking income last year.)\n\nMillennials, the generation that last year, for the first time in the modern era, became more likely to live with their parents than in any other housing situation, have homeownership rates of below 35 percent—nearly 10 percent lower than the age group’s rate in the early 2000s.\n\nRead: Mortgage Rates Will Increase Further Next Year, Forcing Some Buyers To Change Their Plans, Experts Say\n\nThat may be a result of another factor defining the generation: mounting college debt. While fewer millennials in the Bank of America report—just under a third—put off home-buying because of debt, compared to 43 percent of Generation X respondents, the total aggregate student debt owed in the U.S. has nearly tripled over the past decade, to more than $1.4 trillion. Among Americans who have some education-related debt outstanding, the average student loan debt stood at more than $30,000.\n\nAnd there’s a correlation between how much debt a student has and how likely he or she is to own a home, according to another recent report, released April 3 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nIn a survey of Americans ages 31 to 37, the Fed bank found that, although having a college degree substantially boosted one’s likelihood of owning a house, those still paying off debt for their bachelor’s degrees had homeownership rates several percentage points lower than that of their peers without student loans.

The report card is part of an effort to make consumers and employers aware of how their hospitals perform on key quality measures, so they can make better-informed health care decisions. The scores are updated twice a year, in spring and fall.\n\nAfter steady improvement in recent years, California hospitals lost ground in last week’s report card. Two years ago, 37 percent of California hospitals received a C, D or F grade. That increased to 46 percent of the 271 California hospitals rated in the most recent report.\n\nMany California hospitals still struggle to reduce preventable medical errors and infections in patients, despite industrywide efforts to remedy those problems. California accounted for 6 of the 10 hospitals nationwide that received an F grade.\n\nCalifornia public health officials track a wide assortment of patient infections that can be acquired during a hospital stay. A recent state report noted progress in some areas, while other issues have been harder to address.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2015, 56 California hospitals achieved “significant improvement” in preventing certain infections, including ones in the blood and those resulting from surgery, according to the California Department of Public Health. But diarrheal infections in California hospitals have increased 8 percent above a national benchmark since 2011.\n\nThe state has created an interactive map where the public can check infection rates by hospital.\n\nLeapfrog, which has issued hospital scores in California and nationwide since 2012, analyzes information it collects as well as data reported to Medicare. Erica Mobley, a Leapfrog spokeswoman, said the group’s methodology compares all hospitals to each other on a national scale, so a mix of factors could be responsible for the lower scores statewide.\n\n“This could represent California hospitals’ performance slipping in comparison to their peers across the country or could also mean that they may be staying constant in their performance while other hospitals are progressing,” Mobley said.\n\nThe percentage of hospitals in the Golden State that got the top rating also decreased in Leapfrog’s latest analysis. Twenty-five percent of California hospitals, 68 facilities, earned an A grade this year, compared to 43 percent, or 104, in 2015.\n\nCalifornia ranked 28th nationally in the percentage of A-rated hospitals. More than half of the hospitals in states such as Oregon, North Carolina and Massachusetts achieved the highest score.\n\nIn Leapfrog’s report card, some performance measures are risk-adjusted for patient severity and income so hospitals aren’t penalized for admitting sicker, poorer patients.\n\nSome hospital industry officials have criticized Leapfrog’s letter grades as too simplistic for a complex issue and as potentially misleading for patients.\n\nJan Emerson-Shea, a spokeswoman for the California Hospital Association, noted there are many different scorecards and said consumers shouldn’t put too much stock in any one ranking.\n\n“While these scorecards often serve as a good starting point for patients to ask questions of their health-care provider, they should not be viewed as being a definitive source for determining the quality of care provided by any hospital,” Emerson-Shea said.\n\nThe Leapfrog data show that some of the top performers in California include Chinese Hospital in San Francisco, Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach and Inglewood’s Centinela Hospital Medical Center.\n\nHealth giant Kaiser Permanente consistently posts some of the highest scores and shows little variation across its 35 hospitals in the state. Thirty-three Kaiser hospitals received A or B grades; two got C grades.\n\nThe University of California health system fared well across seven hospital campuses, with five A ratings and two B grades.\n\nSome large institutions lagged further behind. Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank received a D, as did the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.\n\nLeapfrog cited San Francisco General, a public safety net hospital, for being below average at preventing surgical site infections after colon surgery and for allowing dangerous objects to be left in a patient’s body, among other factors. Providence’s Burbank hospital had a higher-than-expected rate of patients who developed serious breathing problems and caught antibiotic-resistant infections, according to Leapfrog.\n\nA spokesman for San Francisco General didn’t comment directly on the hospital’s results, other than to say it didn’t participate in Leapfrog’s optional survey on safety procedures and training.\n\nProvidence said in a statement it takes patient safety seriously and respects efforts to help consumers make an informed choice. However, “it is important to understand that health care data are extremely difficult to compare as each patient is unique,” the hospital said. “Often information is a few years old before it is analyzed and aggregated for the public.”\n\nA full list of California hospitals and their scores is available here.\n\nCalifornia’s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development also offers data on hospital quality and patient outcomes. And Medicare posts star ratings for hospitals nationwide, which are another resource for patients and policymakers.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.", "title": "Where Are The Best Hospitals In The US?

But what often gets lost in the noise is how often small and medium-sized organizations find themselves under attack.\n\nIn the last year, half of American small businesses have been breached by hackers. That includes Meridian Health in Muncie, Indiana, where 1,200 workers’ W-2 forms were stolen when an employee was duped by an email purporting to come from a top company executive. Many small companies are just one fraudulent wire transfer away from going out of business.\n\nThere’s lots of advice available about how to fight cybercrime, but it’s hard to tell what’s best. I am a scholar of how businesses can more effectively mitigate cyber risk, and my advice is to know the three “B’s” of cybersecurity: Be aware, be organized and be proactive.\n\nHere’s how more companies can boost their cybersecurity preparedness without breaking the bank.\n\nBe aware\n\nAlmost any company can be vulnerable to a range of cyberattacks. A company manager or network security professional needs to know about the various types of digital threats and how to limit vulnerability.\n\nThere are some attacks that every employee should know about. The most common attacks use a method called “phishing,” or a variant that specifically targets one potential victim, called “spearphishing.” These typically take the form of email messages that appear to be sent by coworkers or supervisors asking for sensitive information. That’s what happened to the health care company in Muncie. These messages can contain instructions that a victim might follow, believing them legitimate – such as clicking a link that installs malware or captures login information, or even making a wire transfer to another business’s account.\n\nThe best defenses against these types of attacks involve skepticism and vigilance. Attackers can be very clever and persistent: If just one person has one weak moment and clicks on one malicious link, an entire network can be compromised.\n\nBe organized\n\nMost companies go to great lengths to protect their physical assets and personnel. But many do not take similar precautions with their digital information. A key computer may be kept disconnected from the internet, but if it accepts flash drives or rewriteable CDs, or if its password is easy to guess, the information is just as vulnerable.\n\nSmall business owners need to prioritize cybersecurity. Without proper preparation, even large companies can find themselves unprepared for cyberattacks. When Sony was hacked in 2011, it did not have an executive focused solely on information security. But hiring someone did not prevent another hack in 2014.\n\nBe proactive\n\nPlanning ahead is vital, instead of just being reactive. The National Institute for Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework lists five main functions of cybersecurity efforts: Identify vulnerabilities, protect against attacks, detect anyone who gets through, respond to the attack quickly and recover after the attack has been stopped.\n\nSome companies are already receiving advice that following the NIST guidelines can reduce legal liability if cybersecurity problems arise or are discovered. Companies can also work with colleges and universities to create cybersecurity clinics, or even consider buying cyber risk insurance.\n\nThere’s no way to avoid being the target of a cyberattack, but that doesn’t mean becoming a victim. Simple steps can have huge results: The Australian government reported resisting 85 percent of cyberattacks by taking three basic steps: restricting which programs can run on government computers, keeping software updated regularly and minimizing the number of people who have administrative control over networks and key machines.\n\nCybersecurity doesn’t have to be rocket science; it’s just computer science.\n\nScott Shackelford, Associate Professor of Business Law and Ethics; Director, Ostrom Workshop Program on Cybersecurity and Internet Governance; Cybersecurity Program Chair, IU-Bloomington, Indiana University\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

And because there is so much variety, some of these moons are more important than others, especially for people who are trying to find aliens.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nEnceladus\n\nNASA’s Cassini spacecraft has learned a lot while observing Enceladus, as well as its parent planet Saturn and Saturn’s other moons. But Enceladus is special because the space agency recently announced it might be hosting alien life in an ocean beneath its icy surface. Below the surface there is also a source of heat and, scientists have just discovered, hydrogen that could serve as a source of energy to certain life forms.\n\nWe don’t have a spacecraft on this moon’s surface yet, but NASA is preparing for such a scenario. Its Jet Propulsion Laboratory is working on a fleet of robots specifically geared toward crawling over and cutting into the thick surfaces of ice on bodies such as Enceladus. Those robots have tools such as heated prongs to melt ice, drills to dig down, buzz saws to power through tough blocks and catapults to send miniprobes out for more samples.\n\nRead: Saturn’s Moon Atlas Looks Like a Flying Saucer\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nEuropa\n\nScientists suspect Europa, a moon of Jupiter, has conditions similar to Enceladus, so it could also be harboring extraterrestrial life, even if only microbes. A probe that could launch in the next decade could make this idea more definitive, and some of the new ice-trekking robotic technology NASA is developing could be aboard.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nPhobos\n\nThis oblong moon of Mars, larger and closer to the Red Planet than its only companion Deimos, is crucial because of its position around Earth’s closest planetary neighbor — a NASA spacecraft narrowly avoided crashing into it earlier this year — and because it is a possible target for a space probe of its own. Officials from France and Japan recently announced those two countries are considering working together to land a craft on Phobos and collect samples. The samples would be the first from a moon other than Earth’s to be brought back. And because Mars is such a large focus for scientists looking for alien life in the solar system, Phobos would represent one more way to learn more about that planet: A spacecraft settled on Phobos, which orbits Mars three times a day, would have a great vantage point.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nTitan\n\nThe largest moon of Saturn is partly on this list because it is electric. Scientists recently found grains of sand on Titan’s surface are so light, a little breeze makes them rub together enough — causing friction — to produce a ton of static electricity. Enough static electricity, in fact, that if you were to build a sand castle on Titan, you would not even need any water; the particles would stick together on their own for weeks.\n\nThat’s cool on its own, but Titan is also a solid candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life because, as NASA notes, it is “the only moon in our solar system that has clouds and a dense atmosphere, mostly nitrogen and methane,” and the only place we know of where liquid flows on its surface in a way that looks like Earth, even if that liquid is ethane and methane rather than water. “These liquids form clouds from which the liquid gases sometimes rain from the sky as water does on Earth.”\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nThe Moon\n\nWhat would a list of moons be without Earth’s only natural satellite? At a most basic level of importance, any observer can look up at the night sky — or sometimes the daytime sky — and see it in all its glory. The gravitational pull between Earth and the Moon influences the movement of ocean water, and the Moon played a key role in motivating humans to invent the technology to travel through space. Space science would not be where it is today without our beloved Moon.\n\nAnd it’s not just a boring, dead rock. The Moon holds all sorts of mysteries to help us learn more about our universe. For example, scientists recently solved a mystery of why an iconic crater looks so much younger than the area around it: a special kind of foamy lava that erupted when the Moon’s volcanic activity was coming to an end billions of years ago.\n\nSee also:\n\nThis Asteroid Is Coming for Earth\n\nNew NASA Images Show Earth’s “Night Lights”", "title": "From Aliens To Astrophysics, 5 Moons To Explore In Our Solar System", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/aliens-astrophysics-5-moons-explore-our-solar-system-2525703", "main": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Chief Minister Fabian Picardo described the plan to invest in new infrastructure represented “a transformation and revolution” of sport facilities in Gibraltar.\n\nThe Gibraltar Football Association is to buy the Victoria Stadium from the Gibraltar Government, in a move that paves the way for local football teams to play international games at home and, in parallel, will trigger a £16.5m investment in new sport infrastructure around the Rock, reports the Gibraltar Chronicle.\n\nGFA will pay £16.5m for the stadium and invest a further £15m in revamping the facility to accommodate 8,000 people and meet UEFA Category 4 standards.

The sale does not include the Tercentenary Hall or the rest of the Bayside Sports Complex.\n\nGFA will pay for the purchase in three instalments with funds it will receive exclusively from UEFA and FIFA. Two instalments of £5m each will be paid in the current 2017/18 financial year. A third payment of £6.5m will be paid in the financial year 2018/19.\n\n“This project will eliminate sporting infrastructure issues for generations to come,” Mr Beiso told reporters at a press conference. “Football will finally come home and there will be no repeats of the current situation where our clubs and our national teams are not allowed to play at their home stadium because the facilities do not meet standards.”\n\nThe revamping of the stadium will be in phases and will start with the laying of a new pitch in December and early January, enabling Gibraltar’s teams to play international qualifiers locally as from summer 2018.\n\nSports Minister Steven Linares said the announcement of the deal was “one of the happiest political moments of my life”. He added “I am delighted to see the GFA able to progress the dream of a Gibraltar National Football Stadium as well as the development of great new facilities for the many other sports in Gibraltar,” he said.\n\n“I believe that this investment will also allow us to create a real legacy for the hosting of the Island Games in 2019”.", "title": "FIFA will finance an UEFA category 4 stadium — MercoPress", "url": "http://en.mercopress.com/2017/04/19/gibraltar-s-football-upbeat-fifa-will-finance-an-uefa-category-4-stadium", "main": "http://en.mercopress.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Here we are, governing, governing\n\nClashes, which left two students shot dead, were reported across the country during the most sustained protests since 2014. On Monday 11 Latin American countries, including Mercosur and Mexico, called on Venezuela's government to respect the constitutional right to peaceful protest.\n\nTwo Venezuelan students died on Wednesday after being shot during protests against unpopular populist President Nicolas Maduro, increasing turmoil in the volatile nation amid a crippling economic crisis. Opposition supporters protested in Caracas and other cities in what they called the mother of all marches, denouncing Maduro for eroding democracy and plunging the oil-rich economy into chaos.\n\nCrowds swelled to hundreds of thousands, including Maduro supporters who held a counter-demonstration in the capital at the urging of the president, and clashes were reported across the country during the most sustained protests since 2014.\n\nMaduro claims that beneath a peaceful facade, the protests are little more than opposition efforts to foment a coup to end socialism in Venezuela. The opposition says he has morphed into a dictator and accuses his government of using armed civilians to spread violence and fear.\n\nThe dueling marches drew parallels to the clashes between pro and anti-government protesters in 2002 that triggered a brief coup against late President Hugo Chavez.\n\nCarlos Moreno, 18, a student, was leaving his home to play soccer in Caracas when armed government supporters approached a nearby opposition gathering and fired shots, according to witnesses. He was shot in the head, they said, and three security officials said he later died in a clinic after undergoing surgery.\n\nLater on Wednesday in the opposition hotbed of San Cristobal near the Colombia border, university student Paola Ramirez died after being shot by men pursuing her and her boyfriend, according to relatives and witnesses.\n\nWe were on a motorbike and they were following us, shooting, her boyfriend said. I left her on a block where she was going to find her sister and I went to hide the bike.

Since then, every continent except Australia (which is a member of the Asian Football Confederation) has hosted at least one World Cup.\n\nFIFA has also decided that Europe and Asia are not allowed to bid for 2026, since Russia is hosting in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. That leaves Africa and South America as the only possible challengers to a CONCACAF bid. So far, neither continent has shown any serious interest in putting forth a bid.\n\nA joint bid by the USA, Canada and Mexico would also be able to handle the first edition of FIFA’s expanding tournament, which goes from 32 to 48 teams in 2026.\n\nBoth the USA and Mexico have enough stadiums to host the tournament as a solo act while Canada also has a number of stadiums that were used for the 2015 Women’s World Cup.\n\nIt should be noted that unlike the Women’s World Cup, FIFA has required that natural grass be installed over the artificial pitches for all previous men’s World Cups.\n\nVictor Montagliani, the CONCACAF President and President of the Canadian Soccer Association, says that “we’ll respond accordingly” if FIFA were to require grass pitches for the Canadian venues.\n\nIt all adds up to a pretty formidable bid for CONCACAF, though there are still some drawbacks. The biggest one could be that a bid among three countries has never been done before.\n\nJapan and South Korea did co-host the 2002 World Cup but FIFA has steered away from joint bids since then. The two Asian countries were historical adversaries and issues including which country’s name would be first on the official name of the tourney and which would host the final led to months of arguing. In the end, FIFA became involved and an agreement was reached where “Korea/Japan” was used for the name, Japan was awarded the final and South Korea hosted the opening match.\n\nPotential political issues could make things more difficult for the CONCACAF bid.

Travel bans being pushed by the Trump Administration could also potentially create problems.\n\nBut Gulati downplayed those concerns, saying that the bid has “the full support of the United States government” and that Trump himself is pleased that Mexico is a part of the plan.\n\nFIFA’s decision on 2026 is still more than three years away but as of now, it is clear that a joint bid by the USA, Canada, and Mexico is looking very likely.", "title": "CONCACAF joint bid launched for 2026 World Cup — MercoPress", "url": "http://en.mercopress.com/2017/04/11/concacaf-joint-bid-launched-for-2026-world-cup", "main": "http://en.mercopress.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

(OZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn an apparent cliffhanger victory, with challenges from the opposition still outstanding, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and President (and now party leader) Recep Tayyip Erdogan are claiming a hairline victory in a decisive referendum that will greatly empower the presidency. Some 48 million of 55 million eligible voters cast ballots on a raft of 18 constitutional amendments that will fundamentally alter the Turkish government, taking effect in the next scheduled election in 2019. With nearly all votes counted, the \"Yes\" vote garnered 51.34 percent of the vote with the \"No\" vote coming in close behind with 48.66 percent of the vote, according to state-run Anadolu Agency. Though the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is not conceding the vote and is contesting at least 37 percent of the votes counted, the AKP is claiming victory. Still, the poll has shown just how deeply polarized the Turkish electorate has become: Erdogan has eked out a victory despite losing the three largest cities in the vote — Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. The AKP's razor-thin lead is a big reason why Erdogan feels compelled to resort to extraordinary measures to consolidate power.\n\nConstitutional referendums are common in recent Turkish history, with six notable polls having taken place since 1961. The tug of war between granting powers to the parliament, the judiciary, the executive and the military is a decadeslong struggle in Turkey. But the April 16 referendum enables the most sweeping changes yet to the division of power between the executive and legislative branches, heaping additional powers on the president in an unprecedented way in Turkey. The vote is a culmination of a yearslong effort by Erdogan to formalize some of the powers he had already encroached upon as president. He will absorb the powers of the now-eliminated prime minister — historically the more powerful of the two positions — and will be able eschew nonpartisan rules and lead his own political party, dismiss parliament, choose judges that were once selected by their peers, announce a state of emergency, and enact some laws by decree. Overall, the legislative and judicial branches of the Turkish government will have diminished oversight on the presidency. The changes also allow Erdogan to run for two more terms, setting him up for possible rule until 2029.\n\nIt is highly unusual for an electoral victory in Turkey to be claimed without winning the largest metropolises. Istanbul and Ankara have been reliably in the AKP camp for years and Izmir, once an opposition CHP stronghold, has been trending toward the AKP in recent elections. According to results from state-run Anadolu Agency, in Istanbul, the \"No\" vote led with 51.34 percent against 48.66 percent \"Yes;\" in Ankara, 51.14 percent \"No\" to 48.86 percent \"Yes;\" and in Izmir, 68.78 percent \"No\" to 31.22 percent \"Yes.\" The \"No\" vote was unsurprisingly ahead in predominantly Kurdish districts in Turkey's southeast, but the margin was smaller than expected. In the Mediterranean city of Antalya the results were: 59.06 percent \"No\" to 40.94 percent \"Yes\" and in Mersin, 64.01 percent \"No\" to 35.99 percent \"Yes.\" Meanwhile, in overseas voting, 59.06 percent voted \"Yes\" while 40.94 percent voted \"No,\" according to Anadolu Agency.\n\nWhile \"No\" campaigners are casting suspicion on Turkish Electoral Board's decision to count unsealed ballots, this has been a common occurrence in recent Turkish polls. Opposition parties supporting the \"No\" vote, CHP chief among them, publicly doubt the legitimacy of the polls. Considering the state of emergency in place since last July's coup attempt in Turkey, there was concern among \"No\" voters that the government would use its institutional influence to secure victory in the April 16 poll. Should the ruling party feel the need to take a stronger hand in quelling opposition to the results, it could also leverage the ongoing state of emergency. Turkey's National Security Council is expected to decide on whether to extend or end the state of emergency shortly after the poll. It has been renewed in three-month increments since last July.\n\nTurkey's shift toward a more authoritarian system under Erdogan will no doubt elicit further condemnation from the European Union, but European powers also understand that they still need Turkey's cooperation in containing migrant traffic and in keeping a check on Russia. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week that the government will revisit the stalled issue of EU visa liberalization for Turks and further threatened that Turkey's government could reassess the migrant deal with the bloc after the referendum. A more emboldened AKP following the vote will mean more friction in Turkey's already fragile negotiation with the European Union. As weather conditions improve and migrant traffic picks up, this will be a pressing concern for the European Union to manage with Turkey.\n\nWhile the vote points to dramatic change for Turkey domestically in the long term, Turkey's foreign policy will remain largely unchanged. Regardless of a victory or defeat in the referendum, Turkey will still deepen its focus and presence in northern Iraq and Syria in an effort to contain Kurdish expansionism and face off with Iran in a broader proxy battle.", "title": "Turkey's President Wins Sweeping Powers in Cliffhanger Vote", "url": "https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/turkeys-president-wins-sweeping-powers-cliffhanger-vote", "main": "https://www.stratfor.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

(Source: Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)\n\nA week after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked women ministers of his government to gather opinion of Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq through social organisations that would be placed before the apex court, the exercise formally began in Lucknow on Wednesday. While many social activists refused to accept the recommendations of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board made in Lucknow saying that the board cannot act like “khap panchayats”, they also pointed out that social boycott was not the solution to triple talaq.\n\nThese organisations also asked the government to take up the issue of education and social security of Muslim women along with merely taking opinion on triple talaq. Representatives of telecom companies were also called to the meeting to take their suggestions regarding use of technology for conducting the survey in this regard and more such meetings are expected before the questionnaire and survey is given final shape.\n\n“The exercise should not be seen as an interference in personal law. We are addressing the issue of equal rights of women, assuring them that wherever their rights would be suppressed, we would stand by them,” said Rita Bahuguna Joshi, adding that women alleged that the 5 crore signatures being claimed by AIMPLB in support of non-interference into personal law were based on vague questions like whether one supports the Shariat law or not, and whether one supports the Muslim Personal Law Board or not.\n\n“We would also take up long-term issues about social security of women, and the working group would sit for more hours to finalise step-by-step procedure to be adopted in this regard,” added Joshi. Social activists, who participated in the meet, were more aggressive in their demands, citing that such provisions had been abolished even in countries like Pakistan, Morocco, Indonesia and even Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Shariat and Shariat law should not be confused. While Shariat is mention in the Quran, Shariat law is man-made by people based on their interpretation. There are several countries, including our neighbours like Pakistan and even Saudi Arabia, where such law does not exist. So why in India?” said Naish Hasan, a social activist working on Muslim women rights.\n\nShaista Ambar, the president of All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board who was also attended the meeting, said, “The AIMPLB should not act like some khap panchayat. They have no right to force their decisions or recommendations on anyone. It is the decision of the court and the Parliament, which is finally accepted.

Here, everything was very clear. It was clear not just in my thoughts, but also in my utterances and actions… The question conspiracy, therefore, does not even arise,” she said.\n\nBharti also announced her intention to travel to Ayodhya by Wednesday evening — “to pray at the Ram temple” and “spend the (Thursday) evening on the banks of Saryu (river)” — but that plan was abruptly called off in the evening.\n\nAmidst the possibility that she might have to step down from the minister’s post, Bharti said she was ready to take “any punishment” for the Ram temple.\n\n“Ayodhya ke liye, Ganga ke liye, aur Tirange ke liye main koi bhi saza bhugatne ko taiyyar hoon (I am ready for any punishment for the sake of the construction of Ram temple, Ganga and the Tricolour).

She had to resign after arrest warrants were issued against her by Karnataka Police for leading an agitation in Hubli ten years earlier. Bharti and her associates had attempted to hoist the national flag at the Idgah Maidan in Hubli, which was a disputed property, violating prohibitory orders. The agitation had sparked riots.\n\nBharti said she respected the judiciary like she respected God. “I would be ready to go to jail within two hours if the court asks me to. I have no problems.

The direction in paragraph 24 (v) also suggests that what is prohibited is visibility of a shop for the sale of liquor,” Nanda’s opinion says.

Instead, it fires up more enemies without ensuring or even advancing US-friendly peace or security.\n\nMany in Trump’s camp will see this awful destruction as a potent warning to countries like Iran and North Korea that even hardened bunkers hidden deep underground cannot resist US power.\n\nBut that is a redundant warning. The entire world knows that the US military can bomb any non-nuclear country back to the stone age if it so decides.\n\nBut even catastrophic destruction does not force nihilistic enemies to acquiesce to the peace that US power would like to impose. They fight back with primitive improvised explosive devices and stubbornly refuse to be extinguished. Afghanistan and Iraq are vivid evidence.\n\nNo US government has intervened heavily in Libya, Yemen and Syria but all are at the receiving end of some of America’s most sophisticated weaponry used by its allies and friends. Pro-US positive outcomes have not occurred anywhere.\n\nAmerican economic power has also failed to make foreign opponents bend in friendship or away from hostility towards Washington.\n\nCurrent reports show that Russia’s economy is standing taller despite several years of severe economic sanctions after its seizure of Crimea.\n\nIts hostile actions against Washington are becoming more brazen, including cyber hacking and firmer military and diplomatic support for Syria’s murderous Bashar al Assad.\n\nNot an iota of moderation has entered its actions in Crimea and East Ukraine despite repeated censure by the US and its allies.\n\nUS financial sanctions are alleged to have brought Iran to the negotiating table about its nuclear weapons program.\n\nBut it is still as dangerous as ever to the interests of the US and allies because of its missiles and conventional weapons besides interference in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. It animosity towards Israel is undiminished.\n\nNorth Korea is more belligerent than ever despite the most draconian sanctions ever devised by Washington and Trump’s armada now aligning in its neighborhood. It has openly threatened an all-out nuclear war, starting with annihilation of the 34,000 US soldiers stationed along its borders in South Korea.\n\nEven assured obliteration of its entire nation has not caused it to bend a knee to the apocalyptic display of the weaponry of the US and its allies. It is heedless of diplomatic pressure even from its only benefactor, China.\n\nThe “mother of all bombs” adds to these examples of the impotence of naked used of American military and economic power to significantly advance US foreign policy interests.\n\nThe massive bomb’s awful devastation has made some caves and tunnels unusable for a few Islamic State fighters but the region has many more havens. Many more militants are likely to rise in rage against Americans anywhere in the world.\n\nThe small area close to Pakistan’s border has been a haven for bandits, terrorists and revolutionaries for centuries. It was used by US-trained jihadists against the former Soviet occupiers of Afghanistan in the 1980s, then by the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, Pakistani Taliban and lately by IS.\n\nAs most previous occupants, those IS forces were using the area as refuge for attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn recent months, Afghan government forces and US special operatives were unable to dislodge them. Pakistan complained that the Afghan government was covertly encouraging terrorist attacks from the haven while Kabul complained that Islamabad was helping IS fighters to conduct attacks in northern Afghanistan.\n\nThe mutual bitter recriminations between Kabul and Islamabad turned into a major obstacle to cooperation between the two countries to handle their shared problem of IS terrorism on their territories.\n\nIt was also preventing a fuller focus on Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists using various havens in areas in both countries along the Pakistan border.\n\nThe impasse prompted Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, to seek a freer hand in deciding tactics. He also wants a larger number of American boots on the ground to help government forces to defeat terrorists, whether from the Taliban, al Qaeda, IS or other groups.\n\nAlong came Trump with his promises to destroy IS. That provided the rationale for the tactical freedom long sought by the Pentagon.\n\nThe “mother of all bombs” was a tactical measure to prevent militants from using bunkers and tunnels to “thicken their defense,” Nicholson explained. “This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive.”\n\nBut former Afghan President Hamid Karzai also rightly pointed out that it was a US military experiment with a previously unused munition not far short of a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nDespite Nicholson’s denials, this accusation will stick because it sounds credible to those at the receiving end of America’s ability to visit apocalypse upon its enemies from armchairs thousands of miles away.\n\nThe future will tell whether Trump is making the world safer for Americans. But it is hard to see how it is an optimal tactic to deform entire regions peopled for millennia by impoverished goat herds just because he can.\n\nClick here for reuse options!", "title": "The futile vanities of Trump’s \"mother of all bombs\" – The Moderate Voice", "url": "http://themoderatevoice.com/futile-vanities-trumps-monster-bomb/", "main": "http://themoderatevoice.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [https://en.riss.ru/], after the election.\n\nThe institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by Putin’s office.\n\nThe first Russian institute document was a strategy paper written last June that circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals.\n\nIt recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage U.S. voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Barack Obama, the seven officials said.\n\nA second institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system’s legitimacy and damage Clinton’s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.\n\nThe current and former U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the Russian documents’ classified status. They declined to discuss how the United States obtained them. U.S. intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them.\n\nPutin has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin’s spokesman and the Russian institute did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe documents were central to the Obama administration’s conclusion that Russia mounted a “fake news” campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Clinton’s campaign, the current and former officials said.\n\n“Putin had the objective in mind all along, and he asked the institute to draw him a road map,” said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official.\n\nTrump has said Russia’s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election.\n\nFour of the officials said the approach outlined in the June strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin administration launched in March 2016. That month the Kremlin instructed state-backed media outlets, including international platforms Russia Today and Sputnik news agency, to start producing positive reports on Trump’s quest for the U.S. presidency, the officials said.\n\nRussia Today did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the U.S. officials that it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an “absolute pack of lies.” “And by the way, it’s not the first pack of lies we’re hearing from ‘sources in U.S. official circles’,” the spokesperson said in an email.\n\n\n\nPRO-KREMLIN BLOGGERS\n\nRussia Today and Sputnik published anti-Clinton stories while pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a Twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory, according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the election made public in January. [http://bit.ly/2kMiKSA]\n\nRussia Today’s most popular Clinton video – “How 100% of the 2015 Clintons’ ‘charity’ went to … themselves” – accumulated 9 millions views on social media, according to the January report. [http://bit.ly/2os8wIt]\n\nThe report said Russia Today and Sputnik “consistently cast president elect-Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets.”\n\nThe report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscow’s effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trump’s favor, because American intelligence agencies do not “analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.” [http://bit.ly/2kMiKSA]\n\n\n\nCYBER ATTACKS\n\nNeither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the U.S. election, according to four of the officials. The officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the Kremlin.\n\nThe overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other, according to the officials. Both Russia Today and Sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails, which often contained embarrassing details.\n\nFive of the U.S. officials described the institute as the Kremlin’s in-house foreign policy think tank.\n\nThe institute’s director when the documents were written, Leonid Reshetnikov, rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a 33-year-career in Russia’s foreign intelligence service, according to the institute’s website [http://bit.ly/2oVhiCF]. After Reshetnikov retired from the institute in January, Putin named as his replacement Mikhail Fradkov. The institute says he served as the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service from 2007 to 2016. [http://bit.ly/2os4tvz]\n\nReuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents. Reshetnikov’s office referred questions to the Russian institute.\n\nOn its website, the Russian institute describes itself as providing “expert appraisals,” “recommendations,” and “analytical materials” to the Russian president’s office, cabinet, National Security Council, ministries and parliament. [http://bit.ly/2pCBGpR]\n\nOn Jan. 31, the websites of Putin’s office [http://bit.ly/2os9wMr] and the institute [http://bit.ly/2oLn9Kd] posted a picture and transcript of Reshetnikov and his successor Fradkov meeting with Putin in the Kremlin. Putin thanked Reshetnikov for his service and told Fradkov he wanted the institute to provide objective information and analysis.\n\n“We did our best for nearly eight years to implement your foreign policy concept,” Reshetnikov told Putin. “The policy of Russia and the policy of the President of Russia have been the cornerstone of our operation.”\n\n(Reporting by Ned Parker and Jonathan Landay, additional reporting by Warren Strobel and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by David Rohde and Ross Colvin)\n\n", "title": "Exclusive: Putin-linked think tank drew up plan to sway U.S. election -- documents – The Moderate Voice", "url": "http://themoderatevoice.com/exclusive-putin-linked-think-tank-drew-plan-sway-u-s-election-documents/", "main": "http://themoderatevoice.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

Today, 125 illegal marijuana delivery services are open for business, more than twice the number from April 2014, when 59 were operational.\n\nIllegal marijuana delivery services are not tied to legally permitted marijuana dispensaries. Currently, only eight permitted marijuana dispensaries have the legal standing to operate a marijuana delivery service.\n\nAs the city of San Diego works to shut down brick and mortar illegal marijuana storefronts, these unregulated businesses are morphing into illegal marijuana delivery services. Consequently, unscrupulous marijuana dealers are simply utilizing their customer lists to morph their illegal storefronts into illegal marijuana delivery services.\n\nWhy should San Diegans care about these developments? Because communities are bearing the burden of the crime, blight and fear generated by illegal marijuana dealers. Acting in blatant violation of the law, the marijuana black market has thrived as our quality of life has deteriorated.\n\nMarijuana remains classified as an illegal drug under federal law. It is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. And yet, our local lawmakers are allowing illegal marijuana delivery services to grow and thrive, without apparent regard for the harm that marijuana poses to our children and to our communities.\n\nChildren living in neighborhoods across in San Diego County are smoking marijuana at alarming rates. According to the California Healthy Kids Survey, one in five 11th graders reported using marijuana in the past 30 days. Growing up in neighborhoods where head shops are a common sight, and bongs and water pipes are offered for sale at shopping mall kiosks, is it any surprise that high school students in San Diego County perceive marijuana to be less harmful than cigarettes?\n\nHigh-risk teens are especially vulnerable when coming of age in a city where the illegal marijuana industry holds sway: Overwhelmingly, marijuana is the drug of choice for local teens admitted into treatment, with approximately two-thirds of all adolescent admissions due to marijuana use.\n\nTurning a blind eye toward illegal marijuana delivery services, designed to increase under-the radar access points to marijuana, makes it even more difficult to protect our children from a harmful and highly-addictive substance.\n\nCriminology theory and data show that the trafficking and abuse of marijuana and other illicit drugs create an enormous drain on the economic, physical and social health of American society. Add to that equation locally the proliferation of 125 illegal marijuana delivery services, transporting an illicit drug to customers throughout the city of San Diego, in blatant violation of the law and without fear of repercussion.\n\nIt’s a recipe for disaster.\n\nProposition 64, the “Adult Use of Marijuana Act,” gives municipalities the authority to adopt and enforce local ordinances to regulate marijuana businesses. Having recently passed an eight-month moratorium on recreational marijuana sales, manufacturing and distribution, the San Diego City Council is working with the City Attorney to develop a legal framework to regulate the recreational marijuana industry.\n\nAlthough supportive of the moratorium, our organization joins prevention advocates in calling for the immediate adoption of an “express ban” on illegal marijuana delivery services.\n\nConsidering the illegal marijuana industry’s persistent defiance of the law, the city council must take action now to shut down illicit marijuana delivery services.\n\nWith our collective quality of life hanging in the balance, there is much at stake and very little time to lose.\n\n\n\nMonte Jones is chief executive officer of BAME Community Development Corp., which was founded in 1995 by members of Bethel Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The fake, but popular, position goes something like this: Conservatives think everyone deserves affordable health insurance, but they disagree with Democrats about how to get everyone covered at the best price. This was the language that surrounded Paul Ryan and Donald Trump’s Obamacare alternative — an alternative that crashed and burned when it came clear that it would lead to more people with worse (or no) health insurance and higher medical bills.\n\nConservatives’ real, but unpopular, position on health care is quite different, and it explains their behavior much better. Their real position is that universal coverage is a philosophically unsound goal, and that blocking Democrats from creating a universal health care system is of overriding importance. To many conservatives, it is not the government’s role to make sure everyone who wants health insurance can get it, and it would be a massive step toward socialism if that changed.\n\nThis view provided the actual justification for Ryan and Trump’s Obamacare alternative — it’s why they designed a bill that led to more people with worse (or no) health insurance and higher medical bills, but that cut taxes for the rich and shrank the government’s role in providing health care. There was, for decades, a logic to the GOP’s dual positions: the fake but popular position was used to pursue the ends of the real but unpopular position. But in the post-Obamacare world, the chasm that has opened between conservatives’ fake and real positions has become unmanageable, and how — or whether — conservatives resolve it has become perhaps the most interesting public policy question going today.", "title": "GOP's Centrist Rhetoric vs. Hard Right Policy – The Moderate Voice", "url": "http://themoderatevoice.com/gops-centrist-rhetoric-vs-hard-right-policy/", "main": "http://themoderatevoice.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

It appears that both countries aim to probe the movements of the United States, which is showing a stance of not excluding military action against North Korea. The Self-Defense Forces are strengthening warning and surveillance activities in the waters and airspace around the area, according to the sources. :: The dispatch of the intelligence-gathering vessels appears to be partly aimed at sending a warning signal to the United States\n\nBREAKING UPDATE IV:\n\nVice President Pence has just landed at Camp Bonifas, South Korea, just South of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South for a previously unannounced visit to the DMZ.\n\nPence is there for a briefing with military leaders and to meet with American troops stationed there.\n\nABC News: “The joint U.S.-South Korean military camp is just outside the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ. Pence’s visit, full of Cold War symbolism, comes amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula.”\n\nVice President Mike Pence shakes hands with Command Sgt. Maj. Steven L. Payton, senior enlisted advisor for United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea, near the Demilitarized Zone in South Korea, April 17, 2017. Army photo by Sgt. 1st Class Sean K. Harp\n\nUPDATE III:\n\nIt is now (very early) Monday morning (April 17) on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe “unpredictable weekend” came and went without any serious incidents – except for an embarrassing North Korean missile launch failure…\n\nVice President Pence, joined by his wife and two adult daughters, arrived in South Korea…\n\n… laid a wreath at the Seoul National Cemetery and joined American and South Korean troops for Easter Sunday church services and a meal.\n\nIs the crisis over?\n\nWas this all “hype”?\n\nWas/is China the key?\n\nDid North Korea blink?\n\nDid Trump’s bravado work?\n\nWas the spectacular missile failure U.S. sabotage or just lousy North Korean engineering?\n\nWill the embarrassing missile launch failure encourage the irrational North Korean despot to try to restore his “honor” by still carrying out a sixth nuclear test?\n\nStay tuned.\n\nPhotos: White House\n\nUPDATE II:\n\nApril 15, 7:56PM EST\n\nThe Washington Post:\n\nNorth Korea launched a missile but it blew up almost immediately, the U.S. military said. It comes amid escalating tensions with the U.S. The missile was fired from near the east coast port of Sinpo, the U.S. Pacific Command said, home to a known North Korean submarine base. North Korea launched a land-based version of its medium-range, submarine-launched ballistic missile from the Sinpo area earlier this month, but it did not fly far. This latest launch came just a day after North Korea held a massive military parade to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of the state’s founder, where the regime showed off advances in its missile technology\n\nThe Post adds, “The missile was fired just minutes after Vice President Pence took off from Alaska, on his way to Seoul, where he is expected to issue a strong warning to North Korea to stop its provocative behavior or face the consequences.”\n\nThe Defense Department:\n\nThe president and his military team are aware of North Korea’s most recent unsuccessful missile launch. The president has no further comment.\n\nUPDATE I:\n\nAs Vice President Mike Pence heads for the Asia-Pacific region on Saturday to confer with top officials in Seoul, South Korea, and with other allies, top on the list will be the “belligerency of North Korea” and the assessment of military options, including the installation of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, element gives the Ballistic Missile Defense System a globally transportable, rapidly deployable ability to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles inside or outside the atmosphere during their final, or terminal, phase of flight. Missile Defense Agency photo\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nAs the Carl Vinson Strike Group approaches the Korean Peninsula (additional destroyers are being deployed and further military preparations made), North Korea is expected to mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founding father, Kim Il Sung, on Saturday, April 15, with its sixth and biggest nuclear test. The following day, Sunday, the vice president of the United States is due to arrive in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nFinally, North Korea’s unpredictable leader has warned, “if the US dares opt for a military action, crying out for ‘pre-emptive attack’…the DPRK is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US,” in response to Trump’s unpredictability, something Trump himself has boasted of.\n\nWhat can the world expect out of all this unpredictability?\n\nOf course, by definition, no one knows.\n\nBut here are some reports (confirmed and unconfirmed), “analyses,” predictions and – finally – some facts:\n\nWhat will the U.S. do?\n\nNBC quotes “multiple senior officials” that the U.S. “is prepared to launch a preemptive strike with conventional weapons against North Korea should officials become convinced that North Korea is about to follow through with a nuclear weapons test…”\n\n\n\nHow would the U.S. launch such attacks?\n\nAgain NBC News:\n\nThe intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site. American heavy bombers are also positioned in Guam to attack North Korea should it be necessary, and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area. The U.S. strike could include missiles and bombs, cyber and special operations on the ground.\n\nHowever, NBC News says, South Korea must sign off:\n\nImplementation of the preemptive U.S. plans, according to multiple U.S. officials, depends centrally on consent of the South Korean government. The sources stress that Seoul has got to be persuaded that action is worth the risk, as there is universal concern that any military move might provoke a North Korean attack, even a conventional attack across the DMZ.\n\nThe danger of such a “preemptive” attack is, according to NBC News, that “it could provoke the volatile and unpredictable North Korean regime to launch its own blistering attack on its southern neighbor”:\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it would “hit the U.S. first” with a nuclear weapon should there be any signs of U.S. strikes.\n\nOn Thursday, North Korea warned of a “merciless retaliatory strike” should the U.S. take any action.\n\nOn Friday, the New York Times reports that China, “which has been trying to steer between the Trump administration’s demands for it to do more to stop North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and its longstanding reluctance to risk a rupture with the North, its neighbor and longtime partner,” had these comments — the “bluntest this week”:\n\n“The United States and South Korea and North Korea are engaging in tit for tat, with swords drawn and bows bent, and there have been storm clouds gathering,” China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. “We urge all sides to no longer engage in mutual provocation and threats, whether through words or deeds, and don’t push the situation to the point where it can’t be turned around and gets out of hand,” Mr. Wang said after meeting with his visiting French counterpart, Jean-Marc Ayrault, according to Xinhua. “No matter who it is, if they let war break out on the peninsula, they must shoulder that historical culpability and pay the corresponding price for this,” Mr. Wang said.\n\nIn other signs of “preparation,” Foreign Policy writes:\n\nIn a major show of force, the U.S. Air Force conducted a no-warning drill of the entire 18th Air Wing stationed at the Kadena air base in Okinawa on Wednesday, rolling out dozens of F-15 Eagles, E-3 Sentries, KC-135 Stratotankers, and HH-60 Pave Hawks for display. The Air Force also sent a “nuke sniffer” WC-135 Constant Phoenix surveillance plane capable of detecting radioactive debris to Kadena, a sure sign the Pentagon was waiting for a test.\n\nAll this in addition to the already heavy U.S. presence in South Korea consisting of 28,500 American troops at a division headquarters, an armored brigade, an aviation brigade, an artillery brigade, naval forces and four squadrons of F-16 and A-10 jets at more than a dozen military bases and installations.\n\nIn the unconfirmed reports category:\n\nRT (Formerly Russia Today – Consider the source):\n\nNorth Korea’s military promised to “ruthlessly ravage” the US if the American aircraft carrier group that is currently on its way to the region takes aggressive action. “Our toughest counteraction against the US and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive,” a statement from the military said. “The Trump administration, which made a surprise guided cruise-missile strike on Syria on April 6, has entered the path of open threat and blackmail,” the statement added. The General Staff noted that, American military bases in the Pacific, Guam, the island of Okinawa, which hosts the bulk of US troops in Japan, as well as the US mainland, are all within reach of North Korea’s strategic missiles.\n\nInfowars quotes a “questioned” report that Japan is finalizing plans to evacuate 60,000 of its citizens from South Korea in the event of war “because the city does not have enough bunkers to shelter its entire population.”\n\nJapan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned Thursday that North Korea might be capable of firing a missile loaded with sarin nerve gas toward Japan, according to USA TODAY.\n\nAlthough Japan does not see “a high risk of military action,” it expects to be consulted by the United States if it decided to attack, as North Korea has about 350 missiles that can hit Japan, according to Reuters.\n\nA sobering fact is the presence of 28,500 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who would be vulnerable to North Korea’s artillery and rockets (or worse) the moment hostilities with North Korea commence.\n\nEven more sobering is the fact that many of our troops are accompanied by their families. Hopefully, the part of the mission of U.S. forces in South Korea, to remove those non-combatants from harm’s way when and if the need arises, will be timely, effective and totally successful.\n\nFinally, it is hoped that the presence nearby of the powerful Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group led by “America’s Favorite Aircraft Carrier,” carrying about 7,500 sailors and representing an awesome array and diversity of firepower will make cooler heads prevail.\n\nSailors assigned to the Electronic Attack Squadron 136 “Gauntlets” prepare an EA-18G Growler for flight on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson .

They quoted Erdogan as saying the referendum result was clear.\n\nThe result appeared short of the decisive victory that Erdogan and the ruling AK Party had campaigned aggressively for. In Turkey’s three biggest cities – Istanbul, Izmir and the capital Ankara – the “No” camp appeared set to prevail narrowly, according to Turkish television stations.\n\nAddressing a crowd outside the AKP’s headquarters in Ankara, Yildirim said unofficial tallies showed the “Yes” camp ahead.\n\n“A new page has been opened in our democratic history,” Yildirim said. “We are brothers, one body, one nation.”\n\nConvoys of cars honking horns in celebration, their passengers waving flags from the windows, clogged a main avenue in Ankara as they headed towards the AKP’s headquarters to celebrate. A chant of Erdogan’s name rang out from loud speakers and campaign buses.\n\nA “Yes” vote would replace Turkey’s parliamentary democracy with an all-powerful presidency and may see Erdogan in office until at least 2029, in the most radical change to the country’s political system in its modern history.\n\nThe outcome will also shape Turkey’s strained relations with the European Union. The NATO member state has curbed the flow of migrants – mainly refugees from wars in Syria and Iraq – into the bloc but Erdogan says he may review the deal after the vote.\n\nThe opposition People’s Republican Party (CHP) said it would demand a recount of up to 60 percent of the votes, protesting against a last-minute decision by the electoral board to accept unstamped ballots as valid votes.\n\n“We will pursue a legal battle. If the irregularities are not fixed, there will be a serious legitimacy discussion,” CHP deputy chairman Bulent Tezcan said. Another of the party’s deputy chairmen said that “illegal acts” had been carried out in favor of the government.\n\nThe lira currency firmed to 3.65 to the dollar in Asian trade following the referendum, from 3.72 on Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day a crowd chanted “Recep Tayyip Erdogan” and applauded as the president shook hands and greeted people after voting in a school near his home in Istanbul. His staff handed out toys for children in the crowd.\n\n“God willing I believe our people will decide to open the path to much more rapid development,” Erdogan said in the polling station after casting his vote.\n\n“I believe in my people’s democratic common sense.”\n\nThe “Yes” share of the vote – which stood at 63 percent after around one quarter had been opened – eased as the count moved further west towards Istanbul and the Aegean coast. Broadcaster Haberturk said turnout was 86 percent.\n\nThe referendum has bitterly divided the nation. Erdogan and his supporters say the changes are needed to amend the current constitution, written by generals following a 1980 military coup, confront the security and political challenges Turkey faces, and avoid the fragile coalition governments of the past.\n\n“This is our opportunity to take back control of our country,” said self-employed Bayram Seker, 42, after voting “Yes” in Istanbul.\n\n“I don’t think one-man rule is such a scary thing. Turkey has been ruled in the past by one man,” he said, referring to modern Turkey’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.\n\nOpponents say it is a step towards greater authoritarianism in a country where some 47,000 people have been jailed pending trial and 120,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup last July, drawing criticism from Turkey’s Western allies and rights groups.\n\n“I voted ‘No’ because I don’t want this whole country and its legislative, executive and judiciary ruled by one man. This would not make Turkey stronger or better as they claim. This would weaken our democracy,” said Hamit Yaz, 34, a ship’s captain, after voting in Istanbul.\n\nRelations between Turkey and Europe hit a low during the referendum campaign when EU countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, barred Turkish ministers from holding rallies in support of the changes. Erdogan called the moves “Nazi acts” and said Turkey could reconsider ties with the European Union after many years of seeking EU membership.\n\nOn Saturday, Erdogan held four rallies in Istanbul, urging supporters to turn out in large numbers and saying it “will be a turning point for Turkey’s political history”.\n\nErdogan and the AK Party enjoyed a disproportionate share of media coverage in the buildup to the vote, overshadowing the secular main opposition CHP and the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP).\n\nCHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has accused Erdogan of seeking a “one-man regime”, and said the proposed changes would put the country in danger.\n\nProponents of the reform argue that it would end the current “two-headed system” in which both the president and parliament are directly elected, a situation they argue could lead to deadlock. Until 2014, presidents were chosen by parliament.\n\nThe government says Turkey, faced with conflict to the south in Syria and Iraq, and a security threat from Islamic State and PKK militants, needs strong and clear leadership to combat terrorism.\n\nThe package of 18 amendments would abolish the office of prime minister and give the president the authority to draft the budget, declare a state of emergency and issue decrees overseeing ministries without parliamentary approval.\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and David Dolan in Istanbul; Writing by Dominic Evans and Daren Butler; Editing by Keith Weir, Adrian Croft and David Dolan)", "title": "Erdogan wins historic referendum – The Moderate Voice", "url": "http://themoderatevoice.com/wither-turkish-democracy-erdogan-wins-historic-referendum/", "main": "http://themoderatevoice.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

He’s paid back his campaign in full—but had to take out a hefty loan to do so.\n\nBunny PAC is the brainchild of Democratic activist Shawn VanDiver, a political consultant and adjunct professor at San Diego State University.\n\n“This is the most ridiculous scandal I have ever hared of,” Van Diver says. “This is just my little effort to expose Duncan Hunter’s lies for what they are.”\n\nDuncan Thumper, the personification of the Hunter family’s pet rabbit, has his own Facebook page, Twitter account and website.

America has become a blue and red stew that never mixes into a purple hue but instead remains separated – like oil and water.\n\nYet, the Electoral College map and even the maps demonstrating county-by-county voting patterns in 2016 offer a skewed view of the U.S. electorate.\n\nDig deeper and the partisan divisions in America are found all the way down to the voting precinct level. In turn, local government decisions follow suit on issues ranging from zoning restrictions to minimum wage ordinances, sometimes in surprising ways. City Lab recently reported that Deep Red Texas has laws allowing for far more local control – meaning parochial interests – than the Deep Blue state of Connecticut.\n\nThe story remains the same all over the nation, and it now comes into focus due to new cartographic creations that use interactive technology to view the 2016 election results on a precinct-by-precinct basis.\n\nAccording to City Lab, the unprecedented maps are the creation of amateur cartographer Ryne Rhola, a Ph.D. student in economics at Washington State University.\n\nThe deeper the color red, such as in the Plains States, or the color blue, as seen along the California coast, the larger the margin in November for Trump or Hillary Clinton, respectively.\n\nThis granular look at the voting process is also available in Michigan, where Democrats still struggle to come to terms with Donald Trump’s razor-thin win over Hillary Clinton, and Republicans are conversely delighted by the outcome, the first time the GOP has carried the state in 28 years. Clearly, the Great Lakes State played a “yuge” factor in Trump’s win.\n\nMike Wilkinson of Bridge Magazine has created a precinct map of Michigan for the 2016 election results that clearly shows people live in “political bubbles” across the state. The latest assumptions are that all of Michigan north of Bay City is solid red and that all of the Rustbelt areas to the south are hardcore blue.\n\nBut the voting patterns from neighborhood to neighborhood are quite telling. Within a stretch of a couple miles, the political views often are nearly polar opposites.\n\nIn Macomb County, which continues to receive national media attention as the ultimate example of a Midwest community that won Trump the presidency, the precinct results reveal a far more nuanced picture. Trump won by 40,000 votes in Macomb, which certainly played a leading role in his 10,000-vote margin statewide.\n\nCurious national and international journalists for the past three decades have labeled Macomb as the homogenous, blue collar home of the “Reagan Democrats.” Yet, the working class southern area of the county is solidly Democratic while the white-collar north end is loyally Republican. The middle area is a mix.\n\nThe Bridge precinct map shows that bubbles of pro-Trump and pro-Clinton areas emerged in November in rather tight spaces. For example, in Eastpointe’s Precinct 12, located along the I-94 freeway, Clinton trounced Trump with 75 percent of the vote. In the adjacent neighborhood located diagonally to the northeast, Trump comfortably captured Precinct 10 in St. Clair Shores with 54 percent.\n\nSometimes, the stunningly divergent support for two very different candidates sat side-by-side: In Saginaw County, the residents of Buena Vista Township, a majority African-American community, gave Clinton 81 percent of the vote. In the bordering township to the east, voters in almost-all-white Blumfield Township gave Trump 80 percent of their support.\n\nClick here for reuse options!", "title": "Don't like the politics in your neighborhood?

At least that guy had some impact. The only mistake Munoz didn’t make was announcing that in the future all United passengers will be required to turn their cell phones off when they get a boarding pass.\n\nMunoz began Unitedsplaining by blaming 69-year-old Dr. David Dao for all the trouble, claiming he was “belligerent.”\n\nAlternate motto: If You Don’t Need a Wheelchair Before You Board, You May Need One After!\n\nAs a PR person I could have told Munoz he was going to have trouble selling that when Dr. Dao was an elderly, paid up, sober and seated passenger who just wanted to go home. On Monday a man claiming to be a United Express pilot called the Rush Limbaugh Show and, displaying the same concern for the paying customer that Munoz has, said, “Flying is a privilege.”\n\nFor pilots, yes. For passengers, no.\n\nFlying for a passenger is a commercial transaction; not a boon bestowed on an unworthy recipient. In this case the good doctor’s “privilege” was revoked for because plane was overbooked.\n\nOverbooking occurs when the airline sells the same seat more than once. The practice received official approval back when the Civil Aeronautics Board regulated airlines. (You can only sell a single item to multiple buyers when the government approves – think chair in a VA hospital waiting room – otherwise you go to jail.)\n\nThen airlines lost money when a passenger called to make a reservation and didn’t show up, because the booked seat remained empty. This may be hard for modern consumers to believe, but back in those days a passenger would make a reservation and get a seat assignment WITHOUT PAYING A DIME! If he changed his mind at the last minute the airline lost money.\n\nEven if the spontaneous passenger paid before changing his mind, it was easy to get a refund and fly another time.\n\nMeanwhile, the market changed but government hasn’t. Why does that sound familiar? Passengers now pay extra to make a reservation on the phone, many tickets are non-refundable and the ones are refundable have a $250 change fee, plus added fare if the new flight is more expensive.\n\nEven if overbooking was justifiable, United’s implementation wasn’t. Like many corporations United supports the free market when it helps make money, but dislikes the market when it costs money.\n\nAirlines raise prices as flight times approach because the few remaining seats are more valuable, but it wants to put a lid on prices when it needs to buy the seats back. Here United needed four seats and it began the bidding at $400 and a free hotel room with meal vouchers, if the passengers gave up their seats.\n\nThat was too low, so the offer was increased to $800.\n\nStill no takers, but instead of going up to $1,200 to see if that would bring demand in line with supply, the airline bypassed the market and decided to use force.\n\nThat money-saving decision that cost United $1.4 billion in stock valuation after the public became aware of the incident.\n\nOverbooking, like free checked bags, is a relic of the past. When fans don’t show up for football games the team loses out on parking and concession revenue, but even rapacious Dan Snyder doesn’t overbook Redskins’ games.\n\nIf overbooking is allowed to continue it should be as a percentage of the load factor and airlines should be required to keep bidding until passengers relinquish their seats voluntarily, not at gunpoint.\n\nThe load factor for domestic flights has been on a steady climb since 2002, when it was 70.4 percent. So far in 2017 the load factor is 84.6 percent. Jet fuel prices are down and ticket sales are up. It’s a wonder United has any frustrations to take out on passengers.\n\nI’ve flown United since it was called Continental. It’s my airline of choice and my frequent flyer level is so high, there’s no chance of me being bumped. But I will say this: In the future if I were a physician, I’d think twice before answering when a flight attendant asks, “Is there a doctor on board?”\n\n—\n\n© Copyright 2017 Michael Shannon, distributed by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.\n\nMichael Shannon is a commentator and public relations consultant, and is the author of “A Conservative Christian’s Guidebook for Living in Secular Times.” He can be reached at [email protected]", "title": "United Package Tours Now Include Hospitalization! – The Moderate Voice", "url": "http://themoderatevoice.com/united-package-tours-now-include-hospitalization/", "main": "http://themoderatevoice.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

There will be collaboration in a lot of things including supply chain, planning strategies and managing shelf space,\" said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, which is the country's laryer gest retail firm. Globally, P&G sells about 14% of its annual sales or nearly $10 billion worth of consumer goods through Walmart.In India, Future Group has the widest network with around 13 million square feet of retail space in 221 cities through a 800-strong store network of supermarket brands such as Big Bazaar , EasyDay and Nilgiris. Future Group is also a large buyer from big clients operating in India including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle.However, Biyani asserts \"Rest are transactional relationships but this is a strategic one.\" P&G's three entities in India, which sell products ranging from detergents and shampoo to razors and sanitary napkins, have a combined revenue of under $2 billion, less than 3% of its overall global sales. The business pales in comparison with Unilever's at nearly thrice as big in the country with products across price points.\"It is standard practice for us to engage with our partners across the retail landscape including all our partners in modern retail, e-commerce and traditional retail to develop unique plans that create superior value for the shopper,\" said aP&G spokesperson.Unlike the Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch rival, P&G has been more focused on premium products that generate high sales at modern trade outlets in contrast to its rivals' route of stocking several mass brands on retail shelves.Experts said they can align their needs with that of a retailer.\"This will allow P&G to bring newer brands and categories into India which can be incubated in modern stores through our stores,\" said Devendra Chawla, group president of FMCG and brands at Future Group.P&G has invested Rs 2,000 crore in India in the past four years, mainly to set up manufacturing units to reduce dependence on pricier imports.

What we are talking about here is a beautiful underwater sequence both, Tiger and Shraddha, recently shot for, for their upcoming action-romantic, 'Baaghi.’ The film's trailer had created tremendous buzz and had received a big thumbs up from the industry and the audience alike. Ever since, the film has been in the news for all the right reasons. And this new piece of news just adds another feather to their creative cap. Tiger and Shraddha had to shoot an underwater sequence and Shraddha being a certified Scuba Diver, helped Tiger in getting a camera-perfect shot. A picture of the two from their underwater sequence has found its way on the internet and we have to admit, we are impressed. Remember how few days ago, Tiger had helped Shraddha during the high octane action sequences on the sets of 'Baaghi?’ This time around, the sequence needed them to remain under water for some time and that is something a Scuba Diver knows best. Hence, With Shraddha being a certified Sucba Diver, Tiger had least to bother about. In a statement given to the Indian Express, Shraddha said, \"I was glad that I could help Tiger out with the scene!

Keep your 10 lakh ready, maulavi,\" Nigam tweeted, and kept his word.Nigam had sparked a debate on Tuesday with four tweets about his annoyance at being woken up by azaan (call to prayer) and termed the use of loudspeakers as \"forced religiousness\" and \"gundagardi\".Nigam addressed the media on the patio of Namah, his Versova bungalow, with celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim by his side, before taking the hair clipper to his scalp. \"I never thought that someone like me who reveres Mohammad Rafi as his father, considers Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Mohammad Tahir his guru, whose trainer and driver are Muslims, has friends who read their namaz in his house, will be tainted as anti-Muslim,\" he said.Reiterating his stance, Nigam said, \"I've spoken about the nuisance caused by loudspeakers in the past and I stick to my stand. Loudspeakers are not a religious necessity. I have the same thing to say about temples and gurudwaras. There are Hindu festivals when people blast film music on the streets and make a lot of noise. Isn't that dadagiri too? I'm talking about a social issue. Not a religious one.\"Straightening out speculation about his political attachments, he said, \"I'm neither left-wing nor right-wing. I'm in the middle, which makes me a minority.\"The 43-year-old said his decision to sport a skinhead in response to the maulvi's declaration was about conveying a serious message. \"See, this is the gundagardi that I was talking about. But I'm not trying to stage an agitation or challenge the maulvi. It's about baring and fighting fanaticism peacefully,\" he insisted before withdrawing indoors only to reappear with his head full of hair gone. In what looked like a spiffy buzz cut in the hands of Aalim, known for giving Bollywood their inventive hairdos, Nigam pointed out, \"The one cutting my hair is a Muslim but he is doing it with love, not hate.\"The cleric met reporters at his CIT Road house in Kolkata soon after the singer shaved his head. \"I'm not going to pay Rs 10 lakh because Sonu Nigam has failed to fulfil all the conditions I laid down. I'm glad that he shaved his head although it looks like he only trimmed it. The other two conditions - that he should wear a garland of tattered shoes and visit every Indian household - is still incomplete. So, he does not qualify for the amount I promised.\"Quaderi added that he did not issue a fatwa. \"It was an announcement against Nigam's provocative statement,\" he said. But why announce it on a public forum, instead of going to court? \"Sonu Nigam did not go to the court.

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "2017-04-19 00:00:00", "authors": [], "content": "WEDNESDAY, April 19, 2017 -- A new study hints that young blood may harbor clues to a \"fountain of youth\" for older brains.\n\nResearchers say blood from human umbilical cords appears to have helped reverse memory loss in aging mice.\n\nThe findings suggest that something in young blood is important in maintaining mental acuity.\n\nNo one, however, is saying that cord blood could be a magic bullet against Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia.\n\nFor one, any effects seen in elderly rodents may fail to translate to humans.\n\nInstead, the findings might set the stage for new drugs that target the dementia process, said study lead author Joseph Castellano. He's an instructor in neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Part of what makes this exciting is that it suggests there's more communication between the blood and brain than we've thought,\" Castellano said.\n\nThe study builds on earlier work by the same Stanford team. There, the researchers found that old lab mice benefited from infusions of plasma (the liquid portion of blood) from young mice.\n\nSpecifically, the old mice showed improvements in learning and memory. This was measured by the ability to accomplish tasks like navigating a maze or building a nest.\n\nThe aim of the new study, Castellano said, was to see whether injections of human plasma given to mice could have similar effects.\n\nIt turned out that they did -- at least when the plasma came from umbilical cords. Plasma from young adults had less of an impact. And plasma from older adults, ages 61 to 82, had no benefit at all.\n\nThat led to a critical question: What is it about umbilical cord blood that's special?\n\nThe researchers found evidence that it might be a protein called TIMP2. It is present in high levels in cord plasma, they said, but declines with age.\n\nWhat's more, injections of TIMP2 benefited older rodents' brains in the same way that cord plasma did.\n\nCastellano said it was \"surprising\" that a single protein had such effects.\n\nBut, he noted, TIMP2 could be \"upstream\" of many biological processes. It belongs to a family of proteins that regulate other critical proteins. Those proteins, in turn, have the task of \"chopping up\" yet more proteins that exist in the matrix surrounding body cells.\n\nBut researchers know little about how TIMP2 acts on the brain, Castellano said.\n\n\"Now, we really need to get a better understanding of what it's doing in the brain,\" he said. \"We are not saying we've found the protein that's responsible for brain aging.\"\n\nDr. Marc Gordon is a professor at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y.\n\nHe agreed that the study identifies a protein \"target\" that should be studied further.\n\n\"But this is not saying that cord blood is a cure for aging,\" Gordon stressed.\n\nAnd it's probably unrealistic to use cord blood as a dementia treatment, said Castellano.\n\nNor can anyone predict whether TIMP2 will point researchers toward new drugs for dementia. Findings in lab animals often fail to pan out in humans.\n\nPlus, Gordon said, this study involved mice that were old, but did not have an \"animal model\" of Alzheimer's. That refers to lab mice that are genetically modified to have Alzheimer's-like brain pathology.\n\n\"What this could mean for human disease is purely speculative,\" Gordon said.\n\nDrugs for age-related brain disease have so far been \"elusive,\" Castellano said. The available medications for dementia symptoms have limited effects, and cannot stop the disease from progressing.\n\n\"We're excited,\" Castellano added, \"about this knowledge that there are proteins present in the blood that evolve over the life span, and may affect brain function.\"\n\nThe findings were published April 19 in Nature.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has an overview of treatments in development.\n\nCopyright © 2017 HealthDay.

His death marked the sixth fatality in almost three weeks of escalating protests.\n\nU.S. response\n\nIn Washington, administration officials are worried the Venezuela government is working to suppress the opposition.\n\n\"We are concerned that the government of Maduro is violating its own constitution and is not allowing the opposition to have their voices heard, nor allowing them to organize in a way that expresses the views of the Venezuelan people,\" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday at the State Department.\n\n\"We are concerned about that situation. We're watching it closely and working with others, particularly through the OAS [Organization of American States] to communicate those concerns to them,\" Tillerson added in a brief press conference.\n\nOne protester, Helma Mendoza, said she joined \"the mother of all marches,\" organized by leaders of the center-right political opposition, because of Venezuela's tattered economy and the resulting strain on her family and the broader society.\n\n\"I am motivated by the hunger that we are going through … [and] for those who are dying in hospitals for lack of medicines,\" she told VOA.\n\n\"We are living in a dictatorship, we are living in oppression,\" opposition protester Karina Ivone said. \"This cheating government has betrayed us, the people, the children in the family.\"\n\nBut Yoneici Paredes, a youth leader supporting Maduro, took a different view: \"Today, this youth is convinced that socialism is the way … for us to build Venezuela's power and the message is to contribute our grain of sand to be a better country in Venezuela.\"\n\nCounter march\n\nMaduro rallied his supporters to participate in a counter march, and thousands turned out Wednesday wearing red clothing that marked them as Chavistas.\n\n\"Today, the entire Venezuelan population comes out to ratify its support for the Bolivian revolution\" and its \"loyalty to supreme commander Hugo Chavez,\" one man in a red cap and T-shirt told VOA.\n\nChavez launched the leftist movement carried on by Maduro, who succeeded him as president in 2013.\n\nIn recent protests, security forces have fired rubber bullets and tear gas, as well as using a water cannon.\n\nThe demonstrations erupted after the Venezuelan Supreme Court's March 30 announcement that it would strip the opposition-controlled National Assembly of its legislative powers. The court — stacked with appointees of Maduro and Chavez — reversed its position in the wake of domestic and international outcries about an attempted power grab.\n\nMaduro's opponents converged Wednesday on central Caracas to pressure his administration to respect the assembly's autonomy, schedule long-delayed elections, free political prisoners and restore other democratic norms.\n\nUnidad Venezuela, a coalition of opposition parties, also organized marches in each of the country's 24 states. In addition, a demonstration took place at the Venezuelan embassy in Washington.\n\nEconomic pressures\n\nThe National Socialist Party has ruled Venezuela for 17 years. Economic pressures have mounted in recent years, especially since the price of oil — Venezuela's chief export — began falling in 2014. Venezuelans face chronic, severe shortages of food, medicine and other basics in what once was Latin America's wealthiest country.\n\nWednesday's mass protest fell on a significant date for Venezuelans: On April 19, 1810, Venezuelans began their quest for independence from Spain.\n\nIn recent days, Maduro ordered troops to fan out around the country on high alert, and he encouraged his backers, including civilian militia members, to defend against alleged plans to overthrow his government.\n\n\"Do not hesitate for a second,\" he urged Monday.\n\nThe U.S. State Department issued a statement Tuesday warning that the \"international community\" would join in any Venezuelan response to the \"criminal repression of peaceful democratic activity.\"\n\nThe statement, by spokesman Mark Toner, urged nonviolent demonstrations. \"We deplore the use of violence against unarmed protestors,\" it said.\n\nMaduro rejected the statement, saying the State Department had, in essence, announced a coup against Venezuela. \"Whoever wants to see the script written to generate violence, death … read the statement. There is the plan,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, 11 Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, called on Venezuela's government to respect the constitutional right to peaceful protest.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Venezuelan Penal Forum, a nongovernmental organization, said security forces in the country have carried out 538 arrests since early April.

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": ["Nafisa Hoodbhoy"], "content": "Over the last six months, the skyline over the sleepy fishing city of Gwadar has been transformed by machines that dredge the Arabian Sea and cranes that set up shipping berths in what is projected to become Pakistan’s biggest international port.\n\nInfrastructure developments have enabled the hammer-shaped Gwadar peninsula to emerge as the centerpiece of China’s determined effort to shorten its trade route to the Persian Gulf and obtain access to the rich oil reserves there.\n\nA mini-“Chinatown” has appeared, with prefabricated living quarters, a canteen and a karaoke center. After hours, the workers have the grounds to play their favorite game, badminton.\n\nA spokesman for the Chinese team in Gwadar said in an interview that his government had invited employment bids in China, then brought the workers here.\n\nHe proudly touted the successful test run conducted by China in November when it used Pakistan’s land route from Kashgar to Gwadar to transport a convoy of 60 containers for export to the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nPrior to that, he said, China had sailed materials through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean to reach Gwadar.\n\nThe Chinese propose to cut down that 12,000-kilometer sea route by about one-fourth once they adopt the land route from the northwestern province of Xinjiang to Gwadar.\n\nSo eager is China to save on distance, time and expense — and the challenge posed by the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea — that it has weathered Pakistan’s unstable law-and-order situation to build its economic corridor.\n\nSmall wonder that the Chinese spokesman omitted an incident — related by locals to VOA — that the test convoy came under fire in Hoshab, Baluchistan, despite protection from a special security force.\n\nSince then, Pakistan has enhanced its 12,000-plus security force to protect the Chinese. That has turned Gwadar into a military zone, with strict checks of vehicles and ID cards, plus an encampment of intelligence officials.\n\nStill, Baluch insurgents use attacks on “soft targets,” like laborers from other provinces, to drive away investors from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. On April 5, as road workers from Sindh were gunned down in Kharan in targeted killings claimed by the Baluchistan Liberation Front, former army Col. Farooq Ahmed said suspicion fell on militants operating from Afghanistan.\n\nThe Chinese, for their part, have taken heart from the security provided by Islamabad to plan ahead. A prefabricated coal plant will be brought from China to Gwadar to fire up its energy needs. Moreover, China will finance Gwadar international airport, according to the spokesman.\n\nDistances inside Pakistan have shortened as the Frontier Works Organization builds a 3,000-km network of roads funded by Chinese investment.\n\nSymbolizing skepticism\n\n\n\nDespite Pakistan’s ongoing military operation against the Taliban, sporadic terror attacks are the biggest hurdle to the country’s development. After 9/11, when Pakistan allied with the U.S. in combating terrorism in Afghanistan, militant organizations put down their roots and threatened the nation from inside.\n\nAs social indicators fell and Pakistan became one of the world’s most food-insecure nations, it opened its doors to China — one of America’s rivals — to help fight poverty, a key factor in fundamentalism and terrorism.\n\nWhen U.S. envoy Nikki Haley recently spoke of nations that use their United Nations veto to stop non-state actors from being designated as terrorists, it was seen as a reference to China’s refusal to let Kashmiri militant Masood Azhar be so named. Pakistani analysts interpreted this to mean the U.S. would move closer to India, even while revisiting ties with Pakistan because of its key role in Afghanistan.\n\nNow the road from Karachi to Gwadar is smooth and empty, with awe-inspiring, wind-carved hills and mysterious canyons that dip into golden sands that run for kilometers along the deep blue-green Arabian Sea. It has enabled locals to rediscover their country -- even as some marvel at the speed of construction.\n\nBut in a country that suffers from grinding poverty, little industry and high unemployment, the benefits of China’s investment are still hard to sell to the average person.\n\nGwadar symbolizes the skepticism. A miniscule amount has been spent by Islamabad and Beijing on people’s welfare, including a vocational training center, a hospital and school. The peninsula’s natural beauty belies erratic electricity, scarce drinking water and lack of proper sewerage.\n\nGwadar Port Authority Chairman Dostain Jamaldini explains to delegations arriving daily from across the country that revenue generation is the key to uplifting the area.\n\nHe showed off a huge quadrangle in the center of Gwadar that “can even be seen on Google Earth.” There, he has recommended to Islamabad that a multipurpose lighthouse be constructed to guide incoming ships and generate revenue.\n\nUntil that happens, the fishermen who build wooden boats along Gwadar beach will likely lose their livelihood as their shanty homes are removed.\n\nAlready, the vacant plots in Gwadar’s Sinjhaar area overlooking the sea have been repossessed by the Pakistan Navy and earmarked for sale to military officials and politicians.\n\nFor the well-connected, a real estate boom is on the horizon. Trader Abbas Rashanwala said he waited for years for peace to come to Gwadar. Now his real estate business has taken off, with investors flocking in to buy land.\n\nMany realtors are betting on Gwadar as on the stock market — making deals online or on the phone. Several sit in the Punjab, selling property they have never seen in Gwadar, all on speculation that prices will soon skyrocket.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s investment in Gwadar is helping control maritime crime. Officials tell how traffickers from Africa and the Middle East used to dock on the beach at night to swap slaves for narcotics.\n\nIn February, 36 nations, including the U.S. and Russia, participated in the Pakistan Navy’s multinational patrolling of the Arabian Sea in a global recognition of China’s role in making the waterways safer.\n\nStill, China’s emerging role in Pakistan has raised many questions. The most prominent criticism is that China will become Pakistan’s “East India Company” — a metaphor for the British empire’s plunder of India.\n\nNotwithstanding the doomsayers, there also is a readiness to accept that development and peace are inextricably linked to Pakistan’s future.", "title": "Sleepy Pakistani Village Rises as China's Gateway to Middle East", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-village-gwadar-china-gateway-to-middle-east/3816566.html", "main": "http://www.voanews.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

A representative for O'Reilly, who has been off the air on vacation since April 11, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Vatican photograph showed O'Reilly shaking hands with Pope Francis after a general audience Wednesday, but it was not clear if the Pope knew who the television host was.\n\nThe New York Times reported on April 1 that Fox and O'Reilly, a 20-year veteran of the conservative cable network, paid five women a total of $13 million to settle harassment claims. The five women who received settlements either worked for O'Reilly or appeared as guests on his program, according to the New York Times story.\n\nO'Reilly said in the statement at the time that he had settled only to spare his children from the controversy.\n\nO'Reilly's show, The O'Reilly Factor, is the top-rated show on Fox News. According to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media, it brought in $147.13 million in advertising revenue in 2016.\n\nTwenty-First Century Fox's last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2016, brought in a total of $7.65 billion in advertising revenue.\n\nBut after the New York Times report, advertisers including BMW of North America, Allstate Corp, French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi SA and T. Rowe Price, pulled their advertising from O'Reilly's primetime The O'Reilly Factor show.\n\nO'Reilly's exit, which was first reported by New York magazine, follows that of former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign in July after being accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women, including former anchor Gretchen Carlson. Ailes has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTwenty-First Century Fox has tapped the law firm Paul, Weiss Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which also looked into the allegations against Ailes, to investigate O'Reilly's conduct.\n\nThe O'Reilly Factor is the most watched program on Fox News and is coming off the highest-rated first quarter in its history, averaging 4 million viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nInvestors seemed to take the news in stride.

He said this review must address all the threats posed by Iran, adding, \"It's clear there are many.\"\n\nTillerson noted Iran's continued support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime and its long-standing hostility toward Israel, and said Tehran has \"one of the world's worst human rights records.\"\n\nOn the international Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Tillerson said it had failed to achieve its objective of a nuclear-free Iran.\n\nTillerson made a rare appearance in front of reporters at the State Department, saying, \"This deal represents the same failed approach of the past that brought us to the current imminent threat we face from North Korea. The Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran. The evidence is clear Iran's provocative actions threaten the United States, the region and the world.\"\n\n90-day review\n\nTillerson had revealed the Iran policy review in a letter Tuesday to House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday that the administration was conducting a 90-day review of the deal.\n\n\"The president is directing the National Security Council to lead an inter-agency review of the plan and then evaluate whether suspensions, sanctions related to Iran … are in the vital interest of our national security,\" he said.\n\nTillerson said that as of Tuesday, Iran was complying with its responsibilities under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which it agreed to in 2015 after negotiations with the U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany.\n\n\"Notwithstanding, Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror through many platforms and methods,\" Tillerson wrote.\n\nAny U.S. move to reimpose sanctions could cause Iran to pull out of the deal.\n\n\"Iran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part,\" the agreement says.\n\nZachary Goldman, a former U.S. Treasury official who dealt with terrorism and financial intelligence in the previous Obama administration, told VOA Persian's NewsHour show that he was not alarmed by Trump's move.\n\n\"It's obviously well within the president's prerogative to review international agreements shortly after he takes office,\" Goldman said on Wednesday's program. \"There's nothing wrong or inherently suspicious about that.\"\n\nGoldman, who heads New York University's Center on Law & Security, also said it was \"no secret\" that Trump was \"very skeptical\" of the JCPOA and that he had imposed several new sanctions on Iran in recent months in retaliation for Iranian actions unrelated to nuclear activity, such as ballistic missile tests and perceived human rights abuses.\n\nHe also said he thought the threshold for any U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA would be \"quite high,\" given that it could have \"very significant diplomatic consequences\" for Washington.\n\nNot without precedent\n\nAppearing in the same NewsHour program, James Robbin, a former special assistant in the defense secretary's office during the George W. Bush administration, said a U.S. pullout from the nuclear deal would not be without precedent.\n\nRobbin pointed to Bush's order of a National Security Council review of a 1972 U.S. anti-ballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union — a review that led to a recommendation of a withdrawal and a Bush decision to do so.\n\n\"There have been cases in which a review has resulted in withdrawing from an agreement, so it is certainly possible in this [JCPOA] case,\" he said.\n\nBut, Robbin, now a national security analyst with the American Foreign Policy Council, a Washington research group, said he did not foresee the Trump administration withdrawing completely from the nuclear deal.\n\n\"It may come back with a finding of reimposing certain U.S. sanctions that have been waived,\" he said. \"If that takes place, and the regime in Tehran follows through on a threat to pull out of the agreement altogether, then the snapback mechanism of the JCPOA could come into force and the U.N. could return to the previous status of sanctions under Security Council resolutions. So, Tehran would be well-advised not to overreact to whatever happens.\"\n\nThe JCPOA focused on Iran's nuclear program and allegations that it was working to develop nuclear weapons. The Iranian government repeatedly denied those accusations.\n\nThe United Nations as well as individual nations, including the United States, imposed economic sanctions on Iran to try to get the country to abandon any nuclear arms ambitions. Those sanctions badly hurt the Iranian economy, particularly limiting its ability to sell oil on the global market, and led to nearly two years of hard-fought negotiations before the two sides reached an agreement.\n\nIn exchange for relief from the sanctions that targeted its nuclear activity, Iran agreed to take a number of steps, including affirming that it would under no circumstances \"seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\"\n\nIran is also allowed to conduct only low-level uranium enrichment, and only so much of it, while also shipping out all of its spent nuclear fuel, turning higher-enriched uranium into reactor fuel, and converting a pair of nuclear sites into facilities used for peaceful research.\n\nProcess set to resolve disputes\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency is in charge of monitoring the implementation of the agreement, and a joint commission set up between Iran and the group of six world powers has been established to address any issues that come up.\n\nThe JCPOA stipulates that if either side believes the other is violating the agreement, they can launch a dispute resolution process, the final step of which is a U.N. Security Council vote on whether to continue lifting the sanctions.\n\nA U.S. move to reimpose sanctions could cause Iran to pull out of the deal.\n\n\"Iran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part,\" the agreement says.\n\nParisa Farhadi of VOA's Persian service contributed to this report.", "title": "Tillerson Says Strategic Patience Has Failed With Iran, North Korea", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-review-of-iran-nuclear-deal/3816362.html", "main": "http://www.voanews.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

But this came after days of misleading statements that the aircraft carrier and other ships had already been headed there.\n\n\"We're sending an armada, very powerful,\" President Donald Trump declared April 11, three days after the strike group left Singapore.\n\nAdmiral Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, had announced April 9 he was ordering the strike group to sail north after leaving Singapore and that it would not be making previously planned port visits in Australia.\n\nHowever the strike group instead stayed in the western Pacific and conducted an abbreviated set of exercises with Australian forces. By last Saturday, the Vinson was sailing through the Sunda Strait, which separates the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, thousands of kilometers from the Korean peninsula.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. officials attempted to clarify the conflicting statements about the strike group's whereabouts.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer noted Trump's comment \"that we have an armada going towards the peninsula. That's a fact, it's happened. It is happening rather.\"\n\n“What part is misleading? I’m trying to figure that out…I’m not the one who commented on timing,” said Spicer.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, on a visit to Saudi Arabia, told reporters, \"The Vinson, as I’ve said on the record, was operating up and down the western Pacific. And we’re doing exactly what we said. And that is, we’re shifting her, instead of continuing one direction as she pulled out of Singapore she’s going to continue part of our cruise down in that region but she was on her way up to Korea.\"\n\nMattis then said, \"She will be on her way. And I’ll determine when she gets there and where she actually operates. But the Vinson is going to be part of our ensuring that we stand by our allies in the northwest Pacific.\"\n\nThe mixed messaging is being viewed by some as undermining the United States' credible threat of military force against North Korea.\n\n‘Duped by Trump: U.S. Taunted Over Carl Vinson Aircraft Carrier Tale,’ was the headline in the conservative business daily Wall Street Journal, which noted “ridicule in some corners of Asia and wariness in others.”\n\nThe headline in China’s Global Times read ‘Tricked Badly,’ while the Korea Times in Seoul bluntly declared ‘US lied about carrier strike group.’\n\nCarrier to spend extra month off Korean Peninsula\n\nAfter the initial U.S. Pacific Command announcement on April 9 stated that the Carl Vinson Strike Group was headed north toward the Western Pacific Ocean, a spokesman for the command told VOA and other news organizations this was motivated by North Korea’s “reckless, irresponsible and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.”\n\nThis raised concerns that Trump might launch a unilateral military strike to prevent or retaliate against a possible North Korean nuclear test on April 15, the birth anniversary of the nation’s founder Kim Il Sung, often marked by a provocative weapons test.\n\nNorth Korea did not conduct a nuclear test that weekend but held a massive military parade and attempted a missile test at or near its key submarine base at Sinpo.\n\nThe Vinson and its strike force is believed to still be in the Indian Ocean, engaged in training exercises with Australia and is now expected to arrive in waters off the Korean peninsula around April 25, when North Korea marks an important holiday: Military Foundation Day.\n\nIt is now confirmed that the aircraft carrier’s crew will spend at least an extra month at sea.\n\n“Our deployment has been extended 30 days to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean peninsula,” the group’s commander, Rear Adm. James Kilby, wrote Wednesday on the group’s Facebook page.\n\nAmbiguous messaging damages credibility\n\nThe perceived communications mix-up discredits some of the tough rhetoric coming from the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\"If you threaten them and your threat is not credible, it's only going to undermine whatever your policy toward them is,\" said North Korea expert Joel Wit at the 38 North monitoring group, run by Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nAnalyst Daniel Pinkston with Troy University in Seoul, said this policy of increased military pressure is not only weakened by mixed messages over deploying a naval strike force, but also by widespread opposition among important allies such as Japan and South Korea.\n\n\n\n“They are not going to support some military adventurism to take a gamble with the execution of some preventive military operation against North Korea. It’s just not going to happen,” Pinkston told VOA.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence did not mention the delay in sending the Vinson group Wednesday when he addressed American military forces aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier undergoing maintenance in Yokosuka, Japan.\n\nPence instead repeated stern warnings to Pyongyang that he made earlier in Seoul and Tokyo, not to test America’s resolve. He again referenced Trump’s decisions to launch missile strikes in Syria and Afghanistan, and said the United States is fully prepared to use military force if needed.\n\n“Those who challenge our resolve or our readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any challenge and use conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response,” the vice president said.\n\nThe USS Carl Vinson strike group includes the flagship aircraft carrier, along with its air wing, destroyers USS Wayne E.

He said there is plenty of evidence to back up his allegation, even though the U.S. has been fighting to wipe out IS and its allies in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.\n\nDuring most of his two terms in office, Karzai had close ties with the United States, whose invasion of Afghanistan to root out terrorist strongholds paved the way for his rise to power. He was welcomed at the White House and taken into confidence on U.S. military strategy in his country.\n\nBut his relationship with Washington has turned increasingly acrimonious in recent years. He sharply denounced the U.S. use of the bomb known as MOAB against IS underground headquarters in Afghanistan last week, adding that his successor, Ashraf Ghani, was a traitor for allowing the attack.\n\n\"They dropped an atomic bomb on Afghanistan — there's no difference between 'the mother of all bombs' and an atomic bomb,\" Karzai said.\n\nIS has made inroads in Afghanistan in recent years and has claimed responsibility for deadly attacks, including last month's assault on a military hospital in Kabul that killed more than 30 people and injured 80 others.\n\nMeanwhile, Taliban has been contesting government forces in key provinces nationwide.\n\nRussia connections\n\nTaliban connections with Russia have increasingly come under the spotlight as Moscow seeks to increase its influence in the nation it once occupied and to counter Islamic State expansion from Afghanistan to neighboring Central Asian countries.\n\nMounting allegations of Russian military involvement on the ground in Afghanistan have drawn concern from U.S. and Afghan authorities that Russia is working behind the scenes to help the Taliban battle Afghan forces and militant groups in the country, such as IS.\n\nIn his interview with VOA, Karzai dismissed criticism of Moscow's ties with the Taliban. Karzai has become closer to Russia since leaving office, saying during a visit to Moscow in 2015 to meet with President Vladimir Putin that he supported the annexation of Crimea.\n\n\"They talk to the Taliban,\" Karzai said of Russia. \"The U.S. also talks to the Taliban. Norway, Germany and other countries also talk to them. Russia also has the right to hold talks with the Taliban.\"\n\nNews reports last October said at least one U.S. official participated in three rounds of \"informal meetings\" between the Afghan government and Taliban.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner would not comment on the reports at the time, but said the U.S. was \"committed to promoting a negotiated settlement to end the Afghan conflict.\"\n\nAvoid bolstering Taliban legitimacy\n\nBut U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who held talks with Afghan leaders in Kabul last weekend, said nations should avoid bolstering Taliban legitimacy.\n\n\"No one should support the Taliban,\" McMaster said, when asked to comment on Russia's overt contacts with the group. \"No one should support armed resistance against the Afghan government and the Afghan people.\"\n\nStill, Karzai told VOA: \"The Taliban is a major reality in today's Afghanistan. The Americans themselves say that they [Taliban] control 50 percent of the Afghan territory. When a force controls 50 percent, countries have no option but to talk to them. The U.S. itself talks to them — they meet them in their office in Qatar.\"\n\nU.S. and Afghan accounting of Taliban territory holdings do not support Karzai's claim.\n\nThe Afghan government said it currently controls nearly two-thirds of the country's 407 districts. The Taliban controls 33 districts, less than 10 percent of the national total, and a recent U.S. military assessment lists 116 districts — more than one-quarter of the country — as \"contested\" areas.\n\nRussia has acknowledged political ties with Taliban. But Russian officials said Moscow is not supplying Taliban militants with arms and training, and that their contacts are only aimed at facilitating the peace process in Afghanistan.\n\n\"We do not provide any financial or military assistance to the Taliban. The allegations [of Russian assistance] are just a rumor and baseless,\" Russian Ambassador to Afghanistan Alexander Mantytskiy told reporters Wednesday in Kabul.\n\n'Regional approach'\n\nMoscow last week hosted a new expanded round of multination \"consultations\" it has recently launched with the stated goals of developing a \"regional approach\" for promoting Afghan security and a government-led national reconciliation with the Taliban.\n\nBut the U.S. administration refused to take part in the conference, questioning Russian intentions and motives. Washington was not invited to the previous round of talks.\n\n\"The main question on the agenda was the coordination of regional efforts aimed on supporting the process of national reconciliation in Afghanistan in the interest of the speedy restoration of peace in the country,\" Mantytskiy said. \"The participants expressed shared concern regarding the rise of the terrorist activities in Afghanistan leading to the further escalation of the conflict.\"\n\nKarzai told VOA that the U.S. is not sincere in bringing peace in the country.\n\n\"A conference was recently convened in Moscow. Why didn't America participate in it?\" Karzai asked. \"Why did it ask the Afghan government to send a low-level delegation to the conference?\"\n\nKarzai said that since 2008, he repeatedly relayed his displeasure with Americans to Putin who, he said, remained skeptical until 2012-13.\n\n\"But when I complained again during a gathering in Kyrgyzstan, Putin told me that there might be an element of truth in it,\" Karzai said.", "title": "Former Afghan President Karzai Calls Islamic State 'Tool' of US", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/a/former-afghan-president-hamid-karzai-callms-islamic-state-tool-us/3817463.html", "main": "http://www.voanews.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

He pledged that the Parliament and the Palace of Justice will also be rebuilt during his five-year administration.\n\n\n\n\"The new National Palace will make the connection between the history, the culture and the future of the Haitian nation,'' Moise said at the site of the former structure, where peacocks wander the grounds and officials conduct day-to-day operations in pre-fabricated buildings.\n\n\n\nThe planned presidential residence and offices would be at least the fifth National Palace at the Port-au-Prince site. One palace was destroyed in 1869 when rebels ignited munitions. Another was leveled by a bomb blast in 1912.\n\n\n\nThe most recent presidential residence was designed by Haitian architect Georges Baussan but finished in 1920 by U.S. naval engineers during a 19-year U.S. military occupation of Haiti. The enormous complex with three domes and pillars was larger than the White House.\n\n\n\nFollowing the magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 2010, it became a twin symbol of the devastation and of the shattered government's dysfunction. The caved-in structure was one of thousands of buildings toppled or badly damaged in the capital and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\nThe severely damaged palace overlooking Champ de Mars square was demolished in 2012 by the J/P Haitian Relief Organization, a nonprofit group started by Hollywood actor Sean Penn.\n\n\n\nClement Belizaire, executive director of the government's agency for public buildings, said a revived National Palace will \"absolutely'' be completed before the close of 2020. He said it was too early to say precisely what will follow but added that the Beaux Arts architectural concepts of the old complex will be retained.\n\n\n\nThe palace project, part of an ambitious plan for an \"administrative city'' covering 30 hectares (75 acres) in downtown Port-au-Prince, is expected to go to a competitive bidding process later this year. There are no estimates of how much reconstruction will cost.\n\n\n\nSome Haitians welcomed the reconstruction plan, noting Moise's declaration that it will mean local jobs.\n\n\n\n\"The National Palace is the most important symbol for our nation.

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": ["The Editors"], "content": "As the forces of the U.S.-led coalition continue to push the so-called Islamic State out of its heartland in Syria and Iraq, the group isn’t exactly disappearing. Rather, it has sought out new footholds across the region and beyond, stepping up transnational terror attacks to keep its brand from fading. World Politics Review has compiled 11 articles tracing the Islamic State’s evolution, and what its changing outlook means for the international battle to combat it.\n\n\n\nThe following 11 articles are free to nonsubscribers until April 13.\n\n\n\nA Complex Battlefield\n\n\n\nThough it has been tough, bloody work, the Iraqi military and local militias, backed by U.S. forces, are slowly driving the Islamic State out of its self-proclaimed caliphate in northern Iraq and eastern Syria. Unfortunately, Steven Metz suggested this month, this will simply drive the group to other locations, forcing the U.S. and its allies to adapt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited Washington last week, and the Trump administration greeted him by approving more troops for the fight to retake Mosul, which has been the Islamic State’s stronghold in Iraq since 2014. But what remains to be seen, wrote Ellen Laipson this week, is whether Baghdad and the U.S. will devote the necessary resources to maintaining stability after the group is rooted out.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January, Steve Metz called the battlefield defeat of the Islamic State “far from certain but increasingly likely.” Seeing the group driven out of Syria and Iraq would be good news in the U.S. and Europe, but would not represent a decisive victory, as the conflict will only continue to perpetuate itself in other forms. U.S. policymakers must be sensitive to this as they craft a way forward.\n\nTunisia’s large cohort of nationals fighting among the ranks of the Islamic State is becoming a domestic problem, WPR Associate Editor Karina Piser explained this month, as leaders in Tunis struggle with how to handle the return of battle-hardened combatants. The country’s muddled response to returning jihadis risks overshadowing its notable progress in consolidating democracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nReports of Chinese security forces operating in Afghanistan have prompted speculation about whether Beijing has crossed another important threshold in its policy on overseas military activity. Last week, Andrew Small looked at the convergence of several underappreciated trends in the region—many centered on the Islamic State—that are likely to drive more Chinese counterterrorism activities in future.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember’s terrorist attack in Jordan, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility, was a brutal reminder of the kingdom’s fragile security situation, WPR’s senior editor, Frederick Deknatel, wrote at the time. For all the worries about homegrown extremism in Jordan, though, the attack actually revealed a popular rejection of the Islamic State. Can Jordan and other regional governments balance suppressing extremism and sustaining the people’s goodwill?\n\nThe beginning of the offensive to retake Mosul marked a turning point in efforts to defeat the Islamic State, which has lost as much as 90 percent of the territory it held at the height of its power. Unfortunately, argued Frida Ghitis at the outset of the battle in October, the group’s decline has provided an opening for its principal rival, al-Qaida, to revive its brand. The predicament highlights the continued relevance of jihadi ideology—with or without the Islamic State.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast January, Leah Farrall unpacked the Islamic State and al-Qaida’s competing recruitment strategies. The ascendance of the Islamic State, along with the resilience of al-Qaida, have as much to do with local factors driving individual and group dynamics as they do with ideological appeal.\n\nIn November, Anouar Boukhars warned of the dangers of growing militancy in the Sahel and West Africa. Both the Islamic State and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb have expanded their footprint in the region, particularly in economic hubs and coastal areas that had previously been spared from violence. Unless regional governments and international actors change their strategy, instability will likely deepen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State’s strategy to expand into North Africa has begun to falter, Nathaniel Barr argued in January. Besieged in Mosul and on the defensive in parts of Syria, the future of the group’s North African network has been thrown into question. As the group continues to lose ground, its North African affiliates may become disconnected or try to distance themselves from the flagging Islamic State brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nEast Africa, too, may prove a futile venture for the Islamic State, Joshua Meservey wrote in January. As concerning as recent news about its presence in Somalia is, it should not distract counter-extremism efforts from the primary threat in Somalia and the region: al-Shabab, which has maintained an imposing presence there for years, and already has deep ties with al-Qaida.", "title": "The Evolution of ISIS", "url": "http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/21697/after-the-caliphate-the-evolution-of-isis", "main": "http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com", "fact": "HIGH"}

{"category": "Least Biased", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "(DW) — After reports that more than 100 men suspected of being gay or bisexual were rounded up and tortured in Chechnya, the Russian LGBT Network has helped dozens escape. Many are afraid to go back.\n\n\n\n\"For the majority of these men, this persecution was unexpected. And now they don't have any money, they've lost their jobs, their families, their official documents, everything,\" says Tatyana Vinnichenko. \"So they come to us for help.\"\n\n\n\nVinnichenko is the chairperson of the Russian LGBT Network. She says that as of Monday morning, 59 men are seeking the organization's help. They had to leave the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya because they were being persecuted for their sexual orientation.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of April, the Russian newspaper \"Novaya Gazeta\" reported that over one hundred men were arrested for being gay or bisexual in Chechnya. It says at least three of them were killed. Several Western media outlets have since reported about beatings, torture and electric shocks the men were subjected to in police custody, as Chechen authorities tried to get them to admit to their sexual orientation and to hand over the names of gay acquaintances.\n\n\n\nVinnichenko says it's hard to say how many were really affected by what has been called an anti-gay purge, but it could be hundreds. Some of them got in touch with the LGTB network, which runs a helpline.\n\n\n\nDepths of Despair\n\n\n\nAround one-third of the people the organization is currently supporting were in police custody in Chechnya. Others were lucky enough to escape before they were rounded up by authorities. Their experience has taken its toll psychologically - and physically.\n\n\n\n\"They are distressed, they can't sleep, they are depressed - they are in a state of panic. Some are sick, some have infections,\" Vinnichenko explains, adding: \"Many were beaten in policy custody. And there is the trauma they suffered from being electrocuted [in custody]. All that needs medical attention.\"\n\n\n\nThe Russian LGBT Network supports the men who fled their homes financially, helps them get new papers and provides them with therapy. The activists also try to find somewhere new for the men to live.\n\n\n\nFearing for Their Lives\n\n\n\nAfter all, going back to Chechnya is not an option for them, Vinnichenko says. She explains that almost all the men are afraid of honor killings.\n\n\n\nChechnya is predominantly Muslim and extremely conservative. If these men's families are told by the police that they are gay, that is seen as a stain on the entire family's honor. Even the extended family is seen as tainted, which can make it hard for the younger generation to marry.\n\n\n\nVinnichenko says that the police often out the men to their families after releasing them from custody. \"Essentially they call for the relatives to kill them with their own hands,\" she adds. \"The men who've come to us say they believe that their relatives would kill them in order to clear the family's reputation.\"\n\n\n\nAnd even though the organization could often quite easily provide the men with a place to live within Russia, Vinnichenko explains that many of them fear that the Chechen diaspora in Russian cities could continue the persecution they were subjected to at home. Most of them want to leave Russia entirely.\n\n\n\nWaiting for Official Action\n\n\n\nHomophobia is not just common in Chechnya. It is widespread in the whole of Russia, where \"homosexual propaganda\" was officially made illegal in 2013. And the official response from Moscow to the reports by Novaya Gazeta about the round-up of gay men in Chechnya was muted. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially simply said there wasn't \"any reliable information\" about the persecution of gays in Chechnya.\n\n\n\nAnd though the Russian High Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova stated soon after the newspaper reports came out that she would seek information from Chechen authorities about the \"abduction[s],\" it took more than 10 days for the Russian prosecutor-general's office to announce on Monday that Chechen authorities are investigating the claims.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Chechen authorities have furiously denied reports that gays were persecuted in the southern Russian region. The press secretary for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov simply responded by saying that \"it is impossible to detain and oppress that which simply does not exist in the republic.\" What the results of the investigation will be remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nToo Little, Too Late\n\n\n\nFor Vinnichenko, the fact that the investigation has only now been announced is a disappointment.\n\n\n\n\"This investigation should have been carried out two weeks ago, when Novaya Gazeta published its first article, rather than waiting until the victims have increased exponentially.\" She believes the official inaction shows the Russian authorities are \"covering for the criminals that carried out these acts.\"\n\n\n\nThe activist adds that listening to the men who have sought help from the Russian LGBT Network, she believes it is unlikely that the \"criminals in the police force\" will be brought to justice in Russia. Instead her organization intends to appeal to the European Court of Human rights.\n\n\n\nBut for now, she says only Chechnya's Moscow-backed strongman leader Kadyrov can stop the violence against the LGBT community in Chechnya. Until then, Vinnichenko believes that people who are suspected of being homosexual or bisexual have no other option but to leave.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2017 DW.

Worse still, it is detached from the everyday life of those under its watch and paralyzed by seemingly insurmountable political divisions.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, there is a general consensus on the necessary reforms that would make this institution more effective, more responsive, more relevant and more politically sustainable. These reforms have become increasingly urgent, as the institution’s flaws have begun to generate a political backlash, one that even calls into question its continued existence. But for a variety of reasons, both political and cultural, those reforms are for all intents and purposes nonstarters in the decision-making circles that exercise a veto over changes of such magnitude.

It was devastating and so many people lost their jobs, lost their homes and so forth. In the entire financial crisis, there was not one banker to go to jail. The only banker to go to jail was the UBS whistleblower who exposed the largest and longest running tax fraud in the world.\n\nHere’s the problem with the system.

It is a bio lab, for sure, complete with pipettes, carboys, microscopes, and flasks. But it is decidedly counter to the traditional culture of laboratory science. The DIY tinkerers who hang out here—in the back of a sprawling space that used to house a heavy metal club in Oakland, California—are working beyond conventional notions of inquiry and research. Their goal is nothing less than to hack nature.\n\nConsider one group of bio-hackers who meet in the lab each Monday night to work on a project that sounds like a contradiction in terms: They’re trying to make cow’s milk cheese without the cow. Using mail-order DNA, they’re tricking yeast cells into producing a substance that’s molecularly identical to milk. And if successful, they’ll turn this milk into cheese. Real cheese. But vegan cheese. Real vegan cheese.\n\nThat’s the name of the project: Real Vegan Cheese. These hackers want cheese that tastes like the real thing, but they don’t want it coming from an animal.\n\nAbandoning real cheese is one of the hardest sacrifices vegans must make, says one member of the group, Benjamin Rupert, a chemist by training and a vegan for the past decade.\n\nWith Real Vegan Cheese, they won’t have to. “What we’re making is identical to the animal protein,” he says. “You’re not giving anything up, really.”\n\nThis may sound strange, silly, and more than a little far-fetched. But it’s real. We’ve reached the point where hacking DNA is neither technically difficult nor terribly expensive. Sequencing a human genome used to cost billions of dollars. Now, it costs a few thousand. The same Moore’s law-type effect has dramatically cut the cost of “writing” genes. Ordering snippets of custom DNA with letter-by-letter precision is as simple as filling out an online form, and the cost is less than 25 cents per base pair—a price that puts the genes for making quasi-cow’s milk within reach of hobbyists.\n\nHowever odd this project may seem, it shows what soon will be possible with homegrown food science. We’re approaching a world where the divide between the “natural” and the “artificial” collapses, where amateurs in their kitchens can fiddle with life to make edible substances that are both artisanal and the most radically processed foods ever made.\n\nIf the project succeeds, will this be “real” milk? “Real” cheese? The answers may be hard to come by, because scientists are still trying to understand the milk and cheese we eat today.\n\nSee also: Milk Does Not Do A Body Good – Massive New Study Says\n\nHow Real Is Real?\n\nRafael Jimenez-Flores loves milk. A professor at Cal Poly’s Dairy Products Technology Center, he describes milk as a weird and marvelous substance uniquely evolved to nourish.\n\nBut milk, he explains, nourishes more than babies. Mothers expend a lot of metabolic energy to synthesize sugars in their milk that babies don’t digest. From an evolutionary standpoint, that sounds wasteful, but recent research suggests that these undigested sugars feed beneficial bacteria in a baby’s gut. Researchers are still working to understand the function of these bacteria.\n\nJimenez-Flores says this complexity can’t be artificially replicated, since scientists themselves still don’t fully understand milk or how it works.\n\nBut he acknowledges that Real Vegan Cheese wouldn’t need to be made from an exact replica of cow’s milk to achieve the biohackers’ goals. “The essential amino acid makeup of the synthetic milk is going to be identical to real milk,” Jimenez-Flores says. “If it has the right caloric content, it’s going to be nutritionally indistinguishable from cow’s milk.”\n\nUncertain Ethics\n\nBut just because this is possible, some critics believe, that doesn’t mean we should do it. Many vegans, in particular, frown on genetically modified organisms, and biotech critics question the safety of fiddling with nature’s alphabet. The issue becomes especially troubling for some when that science is being done in an unmonitored DIY lab beyond the bounds of traditional, more tightly controlled institutions.\n\nThe creators of Real Vegan Cheese say the GMO debate doesn’t apply to their creation.\n\nThe end product—the “cheese” itself—won’t contain any genetically modified material, they point out. Yes, the yeast, which produces the milk, has been hacked.\n\nBut the actual product isn’t so different from food made using centuries-old techniques. Beer, yogurt, cheese itself: All depend upon processing organic matter through bacteria.\n\nThat assurance doesn’t comfort Dana Perls of the environmental group Friends of the Earth. She’s a vocal critic of synthetic biology—the catchall name given to biotech based on writing custom genes—and synthetic biology’s potential uses in food-making in particular.\n\n“We need regulations specific to these new technologies, and we need safety assessments,” she says.\n\nWhen it comes to synthetic biology, Perls advocates the so-called precautionary principle, which would require scientists to prove that a given technique or product is safe before being allowed to forge ahead. Not surprisingly, she finds the spread of DIY labs particularly alarming. Traditional labs are hard enough to monitor, she argues. “Can we be reprogramming life in our garages and be sure nothing will go wrong?”\n\nFor Perls and other biotech critics, the biggest fear is that an organism built in a lab will escape into the wild and decimate vulnerable ecosystems. And unlike, say, an oil spill, a synthetic microbe in this worst-case scenario couldn’t be cleaned up because it would keep reproducing. The Real Vegan Cheese team says it’s sensitive to these concerns—though they say, like most synthetic biologists, that the biggest challenge isn’t locking down their creations; it’s ensuring they survive at all.\n\n“The way we’re planning on growing them, we’ll have to work pretty hard to keep them alive,” Rupert says. “If they escape from our vats, they’re not going to make it very far.”\n\nNew Food Future\n\nReal Vegan Cheese isn’t alone in trying to apply synthetic biology to food production. Indeed, for-profit ventures are hotly pursuing the possibilities. A San Francisco startup called Muufri (“moo-free”) recently announced it had received $2 million to develop its own cow-less cow milk. And in Switzerland, a company called Evolva is using synthetic biology to make flavors traditionally derived from hard-to-find plants, such as vanilla and saffron.\n\nUnlike typical artificial vanillin, which is made from wood pulp or petrochemicals, says Evolva CEO Neil Goldsmith, his company’s vanillin is chemically identical to the flavorful substance extracted from the vanilla bean but costs much less. “Really what we are doing is simply taking genes that already exist in the plant and putting them in something that already exists in the food chain,” Goldsmith says, referring to the yeast cells Evolva is hacking to make its vanillin. “And that’s really not a big deal.”\n\nIs human manipulation of DNA “unnatural”? To answer such a question, you have to ask whether technology itself is “natural.” Humans have been consciously intervening in the natural environment—and screwing it up—since the first stone hammers were hoisted. And we started altering the evolution of other species the first time we planted seeds in the ground. Most of the food we eat comes from humans manipulating nature to make it work for us.\n\nSee also: Have you ever tried hemp milk?\n\nStill, plunging into the core of what makes life work forces us to re-examine assumptions about nature so ingrained that the English language hardly has the capacity to articulate them. Is cow’s milk without the cow really cow’s milk? If not, what do we call it? Is it a distinction without a difference? Or does our meddling in life’s alphabet make all the difference?\n\nHere’s the thing: Little else in human culture comes freighted with as much baggage as food. The things we eat come loaded with taboos and value judgments, status signifiers and ethical anxieties. On the other hand, if Real Vegan Cheese melts all gooey and good on a ground beef patty grown in a petri dish and not in a pasture, we’ll eat it.\n\nTo predict the future of food, the best indicator of all is whatever we’re stuffing in our faces.", "title": "Cow Milk Without the Cow Is Coming to Change Food Forever", "url": "http://csglobe.com/cow-milk-without-the-cow-is-coming-to-change-food-forever/", "main": "http://csglobe.com", "fact": "LOW"}

Hospitalization rates for opioid overdoses dropped 13 percent on average.”\n\nThe study, published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence, was authored by Yuyan Shi, a public health professor at the University of California in San Diego.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Shi’s study is the fifth in recent years to demonstrate declines in opioid dependence in states where medical weed is legal.\n\nIntrigued by the data, Dr. Esther Choo, an emergency medicine professor at Oregon Health and Science University, spoke to Reuters via email.\n\n“It is becoming increasingly clear that battling the opioid epidemic will require a multi-pronged approach and a good deal of creativity,” Choo, who was not involved in the study, said. “Could increased liberalization of marijuana be part of the solution? It seems plausible.”\n\nOne 2014 study showed opioid deaths dropped an average of 25 percent in states where medical marijuana is permitted, and data released just a month ago suggests that given the choice, many patients prefer weed over opioids as a painkiller.\n\nThe news of this latest study comes as a congressional committee announced it is opening an investigation into the pharmaceutical manufacturers of the nation’s five top-selling opioid products.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, the investigation — to be headed by Senator Claire McCaskill (D) — will explore whether pharmaceutical corporations “have contributed to opioid over-utilization and overprescription.”\n\nThe investigation will purportedly be a “wide-ranging” one and will also include the marketing side of the industry.

Less than two weeks later, over a thousand black sanitation workers went on strike wearing placards reading, “I AM A MAN.”\n\nOn March 18, 1968, Dr. King spoke at a rally in Memphis promising to lead a march later in the month supporting the striking sanitation workers.\n\nAccording to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, a black civil rights group named the Invaders sabotaged the March 28 demonstration by distributing hundreds of two by two sticks attached to placards into the hands of impressionable black children caught breaking store windows.\n\nThe Invaders allegedly incited violence against Dr. King’s orders of peaceful resistance.\n\nBecause of the violence perpetrated during the March 28 demonstration, the city of Memphis filed a formal complaint against Dr. King and his associates within the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).\n\nOn the last day of his life, Dr. King spent most of his time with Dr. Ralph Abernathy of the SCLC. While Rev. Andrew “Andy” Young of the SCLC had convinced U.S. District Court Judge Bailey Brown to allow Dr. King to organize a peaceful march scheduled for April 8, Dr. King was preparing for dinner with Rev. Samuel “Billy” Kyles.\n\nOn April 4, 1968, Dr. King’s Memphis PD security detail had been withdrawn, a black Memphis PD detective posted near the Lorraine Motel had been removed, and two black firemen in a station near the Lorraine Motel were transferred shortly before the assassination.\n\nSee also | 5 Confirmed False Flag Operations and How to Spot Them in the Future\n\nFormer Memphis PD Detective Jerry Williams had been assigned to Dr. King’s security detail twice before his final visit in 1968. Det. Williams asserted on Dr. King’s final visit that no black officers had been assigned to his security detail. The day before Dr. King’s death, Inspector Don H. Smith requested to remove his detail. The request was granted.\n\nAccounts differ regarding Dr. King’s final words. According to FBI documents, Dr. King was discussing the weather with his chauffeur, Solomon Jones Jr., when the fatal shot struck.\n\nRev. Jesse Jackson instead recalls Dr. King chastising him for not wearing a tie. Dr. King then turned to musician Ben Branch, who was standing beside Jackson, and said, “Make sure you play ‘Take My Hand, Precious Lord.’ Play it real pretty.” According to Jackson, those were his final words.\n\nSince revealing its illegal COINTELPRO harassment of Dr. King and the existence of at least 5 paid informants who reported to their Memphis Field Office, the FBI also disclosed that Dr. King’s trusted friend and renowned photographer, Ernest Withers, had been secretly working as an FBI informant.\n\nIn addition to the FBI informants, a black undercover Memphis PD officer named Marrell McCollough had infiltrated the Invaders in 1968. McCollough stood in the parking lot of the Lorraine Motel on the night Dr. King died. He claimed to have been the first person to reach the body.\n\nAlthough the Invaders had been removed from the Lorraine Motel a few hours earlier, undercover MPD officer Marrell McCollough remained on the premises until Dr. King’s death. McCollough claimed he spent the day shopping with Rev. James Bevel and Rev. James Orange of the SCLC.\n\nStanding in the parking lot of the Lorraine Motel, McCollough witnessed Dr. King’s assassination then ran up the stairs to view the body. ABC News confirmed McCollough went on to join the CIA, and he later testified on March 12, 1978, to the House Select Committee on Assassinations.\n\nWhile recalling Dr. King’s final moments, Rev. Billy Kyles who was standing beside Dr. King on the balcony admitted decades later, “Only as I moved away so he could have a clear shot, the shot rang out.” Kyles has denied working as an FBI informant, even though he was accused of being a confidential Memphis PD informant.\n\nIn 1999, civil trial King v. Jowers determined former Memphis PD officer Loyd Jowers had been complicit in a conspiracy to assassinate Dr. King. In December 1993, Jowers appeared on ABC’s Prime Time Live confessing to his participation in Dr. King’s assassination.\n\nJowers admitted he believed MPD Lt. Earl Clark fired the shot that killed Dr. King, not James Earl Ray. Although the U.S. government claims that Jowers fabricated his allegations, they have also admitted responsibility in attempting to ruin Dr. King’s marriage and persuading him to commit suicide.", "title": "It’s Been 49 Years, and Most Don’t Know the FBI & Police Admitted Their Role in the Assassination of Dr. King", "url": "http://csglobe.com/49-years-fbi-assassination-dr-king/", "main": "http://csglobe.com", "fact": "LOW"}

An oversimplified and misguided, if not dishonest course of action would be to blame Iraqis for being the radical, death-cult worshipping fanatics they are and ignore America’s foreign policy decision-making, which led to the current situation.\n\nIn turn, one could place Iraq on a travel ban list of nations that doesn’t include any of the countries that created and support al-Qaeda (and then nonsensically remove them from your revised list some weeks later).\n\nOf course, a more honest and fruitful venture would be to examine the events that led to the current situation engulfing Iraq.\n\nAs American airstrikes continue to massacre the Iraqi civilian population by the hundreds, we owe it to the Iraqi people to get to the bottom of this story.\n\nFrom there, we could ostensibly create a future path that might bring peace to the war-torn nation as opposed to blindly continuing the same policies Iraq has been victim to for decades.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the British drew up artificial boundaries for Iraq and forced diverse groups in a sectarian society to identify themselves under one nation. The tactic was part of a wider divide and conquer strategy the British employed throughout the region.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the CIA actively supported Saddam Hussein’s initial rise to power in the 1960s by staging a coup in a bid to undermine the “threat” of Abdel Karim Kassem, who had grown too assertive for Washington’s liking.\n\nU.S support for Hussein continued for decades as the U.S. heavily backed Iraq’s war of aggression against neighboring Iran, even though the U.S. knew he was using chemical weapons.\n\nThe U.S. also secretly armed the Iranians at the same time to maximize the death toll (the war cost well over one million Iraqi and Iranian lives). The U.S. was even trying to convince Hussein to attack the Assad regime in Syria even though they knew Hussein was, at the time, “fighting for his life” in the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nFollowing this brutal war, the U.S. duped Hussein into thinking they had given him the green light to invade Kuwait. As soon as Hussein invaded Kuwait, the U.S. almost immediately turned its back on him and began a P.R. campaign that would eventually lead to an invasion on Iraqi soil.\n\nIn 1994, when Dick Cheney was asked if U.S. forces should have gone all the way to Baghdad. He responded with a resolute “no,” before adding further:\n\n“… if we’d gone to Baghdad, we would have been all alone. There wouldn’t have been anybody else with us. There would have been a US occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein’s government, then what are you going to put in its place? That’s a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off. Part of it the Syrians would like to have, the west. Part of eastern Iraq the Iranians would like to claim. Fought over for eight years. In the north, you’ve got the Kurds. And if the Kurds spin loose and join with Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It’s a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq.”\n\nLet that sink in for a moment: The man who unleashed chaos in Iraq in 2003 knew exactly why it would be dangerous to do so a decade prior. Following the first U.S. invasion of Iraq, the U.S. slapped economic sanctions on Iraq that reportedly killed over 500,000 Iraqi children. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Denis Halliday, resigned in protest, stating:\n\n“Four thousand to five thousand children are dying unnecessarily every month due to the impact of sanctions because of the breakdown of water and sanitation, inadequate diet and the bad internal health situation.”\n\nAs if Iraq hadn’t suffered enough, the U.S. decided to invade again in 2003, only this time, they ousted Saddam Hussein and his entire government, capitalizing on American fears after 9/11 to attack a country that had nothing to do with the terror attacks.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Project for the New American Century, an organization of which Cheney was also a member, released a document in 2001 entitled “Rebuilding America’s Defenses Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century.”\n\nThis document called for massive increases in U.S. military spending and a much more aggressive foreign policy agenda in order to expand America’s dominance worldwide. Unsurprisingly, Iraq is featured heavily in this document.\n\nIn March 2003, the U.S. began its “Shock and Awe” bombing campaign “on a scale that indicate[d] to Iraqis” that Saddam and his leadership were finished, according to then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, as reported by CNN.\n\nShortly after, Paul Bremer, leader of the Coalition Provisional Authority and U.S. Presidential Envoy and Administrator in Iraq, fired close to 400,000 servicemen simply because they were part of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist party.\n\nThis was perhaps the single largest blunder of the 2003 invasion (if it is possible to pinpoint one in particular) because this directly led to the rise of ISIS. In May 2015, Time Magazine ran an article entitled “How Disbanding the Iraqi Army Fueled ISIS.” This is hardly a conspiracy theory.\n\nAs is quite clear, ISIS and the various other terrorist groups that were able to establish a foothold in Iraq following the U.S. invasion have been wreaking havoc and mayhem across the country. As Ben Swann, an investigative journalist and outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy, stated quite astutely:\n\n“Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq? None. In the country’s history there had never been one. But since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892.\n\nDonald J. Trump is the fifth straight president in succession to bomb Iraq. Ask yourself: as an American, or any other Westerner for that matter, what has Iraq as a nation, or any Iraqi ever, done to you?\n\nWhat has Iraq done to the world to deserve this treatment? And what is the connection between relentlessly bombing a country for decades, and crippling its economy – and its liberation? Can anyone explain at what stage, since the early 1900s, Iraq has been liberated by anyone?\n\nTrump supporters and his media mouthpieces can spout anti-Islamic rhetoric as much as they like, but it is a truly intellectually dishonest position to focus solely on the region’s religion and not on the actual events that led to the chaos we are seeing unfolding right now.\n\nThere are many majority-Muslim countries that are actually tourism hotspots, so surely there is something in particular about Iraq’s situation that makes it such a hotbed of violence and terrorism.\n\nAnd it is as important now as ever to examine these underlying events and causes considering the U.S. air campaign in Iraq is radically intensifying.", "title": "The Last 5 Presidents Have This One Thing in Common", "url": "http://csglobe.com/last-5-presidents-one-thing-common/", "main": "http://csglobe.com", "fact": "LOW"}

We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time. . . . I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.” – Doctor Edgar Mitchell, 6th man to walk on the moon | source | source | source\n\nAs recent as a decade ago, avid UFO and extraterrestrial researchers were unable to speak openly about their research without being ridiculed.\n\nToday, the topic has gained considerable credibility and popularity, so much so that not only are high ranking figures from military, political, and academic spheres speaking out, but also popular global figures as well, and particularly at prestigious conferences around the world.\n\nPreviously classified documents that have been released from dozens of governments around the world have also allowed this topic to enter the respected public domain.\n\nThe 2011 Global Competitiveness Forum, at which a number of prominent scientists attended, featured a lecture by Jacques Vallee, notable for co-developing the first computerized mapping of Mars for NASA, and for his work at SRI International on the network information centre for ARPANET, on the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.\n\nHere’s another talk by nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman at the same conference. The main theme of that conference was contact with intelligent extraterrestrials, and learning from outer space.\n\nAs far as documents, whistleblowers, and other ‘proofs’ that have emerged, we’ve covered many in great detail in a number of articles that we’ve published. You can access those articles by visiting the UFOS & ETS section of our website here.\n\nThe latest major figure to comment on extraterrestrials was Elon Musk, founder, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX and co-founder, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc. Aside from a phenomenal businessman, Tesla is an activist who uses his wealth and resources to create a better Earth.\n\nHe touched on extraterrestrials at the World Government Summit, a global platform dedicated to shaping the future of government worldwide.\n\nEach year, the Summit sets the agenda for the next generation of governments with a focus on how they can harness innovation and technology to solve universal challenges facing humanity.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from that speech, which you can view here:\n\nWhen I was a kid I was wondering, kind of, what’s the meaning of life, like, why are we here, what’s it all about? I came to the conclusion that what really matters is trying to understand the right questions to ask, and, the more that we can increase the scope and scale of human consciousness, the better we are able to ask these questions. . . . Some of those things are in the long term, having long term sustainable transport and sustainable energy generation, and to be a space-bearing civilization, and for humanity to be out there among the stars, and be a multi-planetary species. I think being a multi-planet species and being out there among the stars is important for the long term survival of humanity. . . . It creates a sense of adventure, and it makes people excited about the future.\n\nBelow is a snippet taken from the full interview. In it, he states that if there are super intelligent extraterrestrials somewhere out there, which is the generally agreed upon scientific hypothesis, “they’re probably already observing us, that would seem quite likely, and we’re just not smart enough to realize it.”\n\n“Not Smart Enough To Realize It”\n\n“Intelligent beings from other star systems have been and are visiting our planet Earth. They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, ETs, etc. . . . They are visiting Earth NOW; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking.” – Theodor C. Loder III, Phd, Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire | source\n\nI think Musk is right — they are probably already watching us, we just don’t realize it yet. But things are changing. Numerous efforts are being made to educate the public on this subject, from the most credible sources available. Scientific publications, video footage, and photos have already been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals for a number of years. | source\n\nBelow is a powerful statement made by former NASA astronaut and Princeton physics professor Dr. Brian O’Leary, who says that there is “abundant evidence that we are being contacted, and that intelligent civilizations have been visiting for a very long time.”\n\nAgain, if you want to sift through some of this evidence, we’ve presented it in a number of articles, you can view in chronological order in the UFOS & ETS section of our website here.\n\nWhy the Masses Haven’t Realized It — Or Have They?\n\n“Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” – Former head of CIA Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 | source\n\nMovies and television shows bombard us constantly with stories of extraterrestrial invasions, and despite all of the evidence available, the fact that we are being and have been visited by extraterrestrials can be a scary thought, particularly given the way extraterrestrials are typically portrayed.\n\nWith a massive disinformation campaign that has focused on covering up these facts for decades, along with the mass ridicule of this subject for anyone who took it seriously in the past, it quickly escaped the minds of the masses and many people considered the notion of ongoing intelligent contact with our planet from extraterrestrials completely preposterous.\n\nA great quote from Carl Sagan comes to mind:\n\nOne the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re not longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.\n\nCurrent public perception of UFOs and extraterrestrials reveals how easily our minds can be influenced, and how quickly our thoughts about a subject can be given to us, even subconsciously. It begs the question, how many other beliefs do we share that have been, in a sense, ‘programmed’ into us by powerful groups of people with an agenda?\n\n“There are objects in our atmosphere which are technically miles in advance of anything we can deploy, that we have no means of stopping them coming here … [and] that there is a serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many years by people from outer space, from other civilizations.\n\nThat it behooves us, in case some of these people in the future or now should turn hostile, to find out who they are, where they come from, and what they want.\n\nThis should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not the subject of ‘rubishing’ by tabloid newspapers.” – Lord Admiral Hill-Norton, Former Chief of Defence Staff, 5 Star Admiral of the Royal Navy, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee | source\n\nAll this being said, the fact that UFOs/extraterrestrials is one of the most searched subjects on the web suggests that people are at least curious to learn the truth.\n\nWhat Extraterrestrial Contact Is Really About\n\nHumanity is waking up to the fact that this type of thing has been happening for quite some time, and the realization comes at a time when humanity is experiencing a massive shift in consciousness. By ‘shift in consciousness,’ I mean that we are letting go of long-held beliefs that have been rendered obsolete by new evidence.\n\nThat being said, no matter how much evidence presents itself, it’s always going to be difficult to let go of belief systems, but minds are indeed opening. It was great to see Musk mention the topic of consciousness in his talk as well as mention that it’s important to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness, and part of increasing that scope, as Musk identifies, is asking the right questions.\n\nSome of these questions deal with pulling back the veil that’s blinded the masses for decades. It’s not that we aren’t smart enough, but rather that we have been lied to and misled for years.\n\n“An extraterrestrial influence is investigating our planet. Something is monitoring the planet and they are monitoring it very cautiously.” – Former Sen. Mike Gravel (D-Alaska), 2008 presidential candidate\n\nAcknowledging the fact that we are being visited opens up so many questions in all fields, from religion, to history, to new theories of scientific knowledge and many more, as I am sure you can imagine.\n\nIf they have been around, and have been watching us, why has there not been major contact? There is sufficient evidence showing that contact has indeed occurred on an individual level, with perhaps millions of people, but a ‘one time’ mass disclosure event has yet to take place.\n\nPerhaps Musk is not sharing knowledge that he’s been privy too? Given the circles that he finds himself in, it would not be surprising. Furthermore, when in the business of new energy generation, the topic of UFOs is most likely to come up, because one of the main questions is, how are they getting here?\n\nWhat propulsion systems do they use? UFOs that are tracked on military radar and visually confirmed by pilots have performed maneuvers that completely defy our known laws of physics, and make maneuvers no known aircraft on Earth can.\n\n“There is another way, whether it’s wormholes or warping space, there’s got to be a way to generate energy so that you can pull it out of the vacuum, and the fact that they’re here shows us that they found a way.” | source\n\nThe statement above comes from Dr. Jack Kasher, Ph.D, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Nebraska. He is one out of multiple physicists (and scientists in general) to examine the truly remarkable NASA STS-48 footage. You can see that footage here.\n\nI’ve been studying the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon for a very long time, and one common theme that constantly comes up is a shift in consciousness, a change in the way we see and care for our planet, and a deeper understanding about life and the true nature of reality.\n\nIs it a coincidence that the ET/UFO topic continues to gain attention as we turn our focus toward global cooperation? A desire for peace? A desire for a clean, green planet clear of corporate, government, and financial interest?\n\nCan we work together, can we solve these problems in order to become the spacefaring race that Musk so passionately speaks of? It seems other civilizations have done so, civilizations that have probably already tackled and overcome these same problems we now face.\n\n“The Earth is about four and a half billion years go, that’s 45 hundred million years old. What if theres another planet that’s almost exactly like us, almost exactly 45 hundred and 1 million years old. They’re a million years ahead of us, and on a galactic scale they’re almost our twin brothers. We’ll have solved all these problems.” – Jack Kasher | source\n\nA ‘Spiritual’ Revolution\n\nSome people believe that ‘spirituality’ is another religion. And it can be…\n\nThat being said, spirituality doesn’t really have the same negative connotations that religion has, lacking its long history of violence, subjugation, and corruption. Spirituality isn’t concerned with converting people to specific beliefs and behaviors.\n\nIt has roots in the most ancient of history, and also correlations with a lot of science that’s emerging today, mainly in the areas of quantum physics and neuroscience, which are now revealing the vast interconnectedness of all things. I think it would be wise to assume that this interconnectedness is not only planetary, but interplanetary and beyond.\n\nA big part of the extraterrestrial question coincides with this type of ‘spirituality.’ While there will always be people who are quick to label aliens as angels or demons, perhaps the best approach is, as the Dalai Lama emphasized a few years ago, to view ‘them’ as ‘us,’ and refuse the urge to label and judge them.\n\nThe spiritual aspect of this topic is also emphasized in indigenous lore from all over the world.\n\n“My people tell of Star People who came to us many generations ago. The Star people brought spiritual teachings and stories and maps of the cosmos and they offered these freely. They were kind, loving and set a great example. When they left us, my people say there was a loneliness like no other.” – Richard Wagamese, one of Canada’s foremost authors and storytellers from the Wabaseemoong First Nation in Northwestern Ontario | source\n\nIf they are here, and have been for a while, I guess we can rule out any type of ‘alien’ invasion, but a staged alien invasion could be another story…\n\nAt the end of the day, all of the research I and many have others have done suggests that something special is happening, and there are many out there watching us, and perhaps assisting us in ways we do not know, to see if we can succeed in making the human experience beneficial for all life on the planet.\n\nPart of that is waking up to all of the lies and deceit that plagues this planet, presenting solutions to our problems, and then implementing those solutions. Many barriers may stand in the way of this progress, but we can’t break them down until they are at least identified.\n\nThis is one aspect of the massive shift in consciousness that’s occurring right now, and how it may tie to the supposed “super intelligent aliens” that may not only be visiting us right now, but walking among us.\n\nPerhaps extraterrestrial contact can help us find out who we are and where we come from. There is a bigger picture here, and it requires us to let go of all of our judgements and destructive ways of life, and embrace the interconnectedness of all that is.\n\nWhat do you think? I’ll end this article with a great video that can give us all something to think about. There is ample reason to believe that these changes spoken below are directly correlated with some of the extraterrestrial groups currently visiting our planet. Obviously Rainn mentions nothing of that topic, but that’s not why I’m sharing this video.\n\nFull ET disclosure knocks opens pandora’s box, and makes it’s way into all aspects of our lives, if allowed to open…One thing is for certain, “the truth is going to come out sooner our later.” – Colonel Ross Dedrickson taken from this interview.\n\nDisclaimer | Any views or opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author/source presented below, and do not necessarily reflect the position of CSGlobe or its staff.", "title": "Elon Musk: “If There Are Super Intelligent Aliens, They're Probably Already Observing Us\"", "url": "http://csglobe.com/musk-aliens-probably-observing-us/", "main": "http://csglobe.com", "fact": "LOW"}

Sandra Bishop of the Our Family Farms Coalition, which supports HB 2739, spoke to the East Oregonian website saying, “This is not a wild legal grab. We will not be compensated for our angst. We will only be compensated for provable legal damages.”\n\nContamination from GMOs can cause farmers to have dramatic economic losses.\n\nThey run the risk of being rejected by export markets that have banned genetically modified organisms. GMO chemicals can also lead to highly resistant weeds and insects that are nearly impossible for farmers to eradicate, and are too time-consuming for them to manage.\n\nFarmers who own organic crops could be subjected to losing their organic certification if their produce becomes contaminated, which would diminish the premium earned on their product.\n\nAs more markets are looking to carry non-GMO produce, farmers have the opportunity to meet that need and typically get paid a higher price for their product.\n\nBut the difficulty in preventing contamination is a constant threat that they face.\n\nFor years Monsanto has bullied farmers when their GMO seeds ended up on the farmers’ land. While contamination can occur many different ways, by no fault of their own, farmers have been sued when unauthorized GMO crops show up in their fields.\n\nThe companies that own the seed patents typically win these cases, leaving farmers with few options. This bill, if passed, would give power back to landowners who want to continue to have GMO-free farms.\n\nPlaintiffs who decide to sue these companies could receive up to three times the amount of damages caused by the GMOs that harmed their land under the guidelines of HB 2739.\n\nProponents of the bill find this solution to be fair because it now forces Monsanto, and companies like them, to take responsibility since they are the ones who profit from GMO patents.\n\nIf they believe it will affect their bottom line, they may be more inclined to regulate the contamination. Supporters also note that finding the culprits will be fairly simple by using the genetic tests established when patents are approved.\n\nThere are some opponents to the bill of course, including farmers that depend on GMO seeds.

It’s a seemingly endless stream of lurid vignettes—Faked X-ray reports. Forged retinal scans. Phony lab tests. Secretly amputated limbs. All done in the name of science when researchers thought that nobody was watching.”\n\n“That misconduct happens isn’t shocking. What is: When the FDA finds scientific fraud or misconduct, the agency doesn’t notify the public, the medical establishment, or even the scientific community that the results of a medical experiment are not to be trusted. On the contrary. For more than a decade, the FDA has shown a pattern of burying the details of misconduct. As a result, nobody ever finds out which data is bogus, which experiments are tainted, and which drugs might be on the market under false pretenses.”\n\n“The FDA has repeatedly hidden evidence of scientific fraud not just from the public, but also from its most trusted scientific advisers, even as they were deciding whether or not a new drug should be allowed on the market. Even a congressional panel investigating a case of fraud regarding a dangerous drug couldn’t get forthright answers. For an agency devoted to protecting the public from bogus medical science, the FDA seems to be spending an awful lot of effort protecting the perpetrators of bogus science from the public.”\n\nThere is much more, but that taste should be enough to convince any sane person that the FDA is a rogue agency, dedicated to protecting and forwarding the profits of pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIn past articles, I’ve revealed that, every year in the US, FDA-approved medical drugs kill 106,000 Americans. This conservative assessment was made by Dr. Barbara Starfield, in her landmark July 26, 2000, review in the Journal of the American Medical Association: “Is US Health Really the Best in the World?”\n\nIn my 2009 interview with Dr. Starfield, she emphatically stated that she was aware of no systematic federal effort to fix this horrendous ongoing disaster.\n\nIn fact, the FDA had (until they removed it) a page on their own site which stated: “Over 2 MILLION serious ADRs (adverse drug reactions yearly.” “100,000 DEATHS yearly.” The FDA was highlighting the catastrophic effects of medical drugs they themselves were certifying as safe and effective.\n\nOf course, they took no responsibility.\n\nThis is on the order of a defendant saying, “Did I kill people? Well, if you look in that field over there, if you start digging, you’ll find a number of bodies. I know. I put them there. But I wasn’t really responsible. Why would you place me on trial?”\n\nIn a stunning interview with Truthout’s Martha Rosenberg (7/29/12), former FDA drug reviewer, Ronald Kavanagh, exposed the FDA as a relentless criminal mafia protecting its client, Big Pharma, with a host of mob strategies:\n\nKavanagh: “…widespread racketeering, including witness tampering and witness retaliation.”\n\n“I was threatened with prison.”\n\n“One [FDA] manager threatened my children…I was afraid that I could be killed for talking to Congress and criminal investigators.”\n\nKavanagh reviewed new drug applications made to the FDA by pharmaceutical companies. He was one of the holdouts at the agency who insisted the drugs had to be safe and effective before being released to the public.\n\nBut honest appraisal wasn’t part of the FDA culture, and Kavanagh swam against the tide, until he realized his life and the life of his children was on the line.\n\nWhat was his secret task at the FDA? “Drug reviewers were clearly told not to question drug companies and that our job was to approve drugs.” In other words, rubber stamp them. Say the drugs were safe and effective when they were not.\n\nVeterans of the Armed Forces, take note: Kavanagh remarked that the drug pyridostigmine, given to US troops to prevent the later effects of nerve gas, “actually increased the lethality” of certain nerve agents.\n\nKavanagh recalled being given records of safety data on a drug—and then his bosses told him which sections not to read. Obviously, they knew the drug was dangerous and they knew exactly where, in the reports, that fact would be revealed.\n\nGetting the picture?\n\nAnyone who believes the FDA can be fixed with a few adjustments to rules and a few personnel changes is whistling in the dark.\n\nTalk about a swamp.\n\nNothing short of shutting down the Agency, fumigating the buildings, and starting over with actual humans in charge, humans who believe in human health, would work.\n\nScores of criminal prosecutions, convictions, and very long prison terms for current FDA employees would also be necessary.\n\nThis article first appeared at NoMoreFakeNews.com.", "title": "Shut down the FDA, Start Over  Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!", "url": "https://www.infowars.com/shut-down-the-fda-start-over/", "main": "http://www.infowars.com", "fact": "LOW"}

{"category": "Conspiracy-Pseudoscience", "date": "2017-04-19 11:13:46-05:00", "authors": ["Jerome Corsi"], "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, an avowed enemy of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders seeking to end the Obama administration Net Worth Sweep, has built a personal fortune of approximately $50 million since being elected to the Senate in 2006.\n\nBut Corker has been anything but forthcoming in accurately disclosing the true amount of his wealth, or making it clear to the public the methods he used to accumulate it.\n\nConsider the many different estimates of Corker’s wealth in the public record since he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn 2006, after winning his first election for the Senate, Forbes reported Corker “boasts an estimated $64 million to $236 million fortune, according to the financial disclosure he filed to the Senate.”\n\nThen, on Dec. 14, 2014, the Hill reported that Corker, after filing 83 amendments to his financial disclosure reports dating back to his arrival to the Senate in 2007, reported his net worth at only $18 million.\n\nIn 2014, OpenSecrets.org listed the “average estimate” of Corker’s net worth at $45.8 million, with the minimum net worth estimate at $13.9 million, and the maximum net worth estimate at $76.9 million.\n\nOn Aug. 25, 2014, the Tennessean reported Corker held assets in 2013 worth between $19.02 million and $89.7 million, based on a Senate financial disclosure form filed that month, compared with the $18.67 million to $91.55 million disclosed on his 2012 form.\n\nThe truth is that Corker is one of the wealthiest members of the House of Representatives, although he has always been evasive about just how rich he truly may be.\n\nBut even as he was being considered in May 2016 to be tapped as Donald Trump’s vice presidential candidate, Corker was dogged by continuing FBI and SEC investigations into his finances, as well as a history of having to refile his Congressional financial disclosure forms after admitting he had failed to list dozens of business dealings and hundreds of stock trades, resulting in millions of dollars in previously unreported or under-reported income.\n\n“Federal investigators are looking into possible financial irregularities involving CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based real estate investment trusts that owns or manages dozens of shopping centers and malls across the country,” Politico reported on May 31, 2016.\n\n“Corker has bought and sold millions of dollars in CBL stock since he was elected to the Senate in 2006, but failed to disclose several of those disclosures,” Politico continued. “Now Corker finds himself ensnared in a federal probe.”\n\nA close examination of his financial history makes clear Corker has aggressively taken advantage of the Congressional privilege absolving him from criminal responsibility for inside trading, in what Corker has described as “day-trading.”\n\nInfowars.com published for the first time last week evidence documenting Corker has invested possibly as much as $50 million in hedge funds that included a transaction in 2008 with Pointer Management LLC in Chattanooga in which Corker purchased credit default swaps, derivative instruments that shorted the Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that Corker now wants to close.\n\nFrom his days as mayor of Chattanooga (before his run for the Senate in 2006) Corker has a history of benefiting handsomely from billions of dollars in commercial bank loans (notably from Wells Fargo and UBS) that he and his partners used to make promising real estate investments and/or to refinance troubled real estate deals which were about to go belly-up.\n\nLet’s just consider the tip-of-the iceberg evidence.\n\nIn May 2016, the FBI and the SEC began investigating Corker’s ties to CBL & Associate Properties, Inc. – the real estate firm that backed Corker at the start of his real estate career in Chattanooga – for alleged accounting fraud, including falsifying information to banks when applying for loans, and failing to report on his Senate personal financial disclosures of millions of dollars profit he made actively trading CBL stock.\n\nHere was a typical pattern of Corker’s CBL trades that reeks suspiciously of the type of insider information that would have landed an ordinary citizen behind bars in a federal prison:\n\nCorker evidently purchased between $2 and $10 million of CBL stock just prior to a July 2010 announcement that Swiss-headquartered UBS bank (a bank with a prominent presence in Chattanooga that rented space in a Corker-owned building) was upgrading its CBL rating from “sell” to “neutral.”\n\nLess than a month later, Corker unloaded between $3 and $12 million of his CBL stock, days before UBS returned the CBL rating to “sell.”\n\nIn the interim, CBL’s stock price leapt by more than 35%, from $11.83 per share to $14.66, netting Corker some $1.87 million in slightly more than three weeks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 3, 2015, that Corker purchased between $1 million and $5 million in 2011 and sold them five months later for a 42 percent gain – trades Corker only disclosed after questions from the WSJ about “apparent discrepancies” in his Senate financial-disclosure reports – trades that occurred after Corker made a pair of purchases of CBL stock in the name of his daughters that the WSJ estimated netted him more than $1 million.\n\nCBL has “given generously” to Corker’s political campaigns, with CBL executives, directors, and spouses contributing more than $88,706 to his campaign committee and PAC since Corker’s 2006 run for the Senate.\n\nUBS is not the only bank important to building Crocker’s wealth.\n\nInfowars.com previously reported a $28 million-dollar refinancing to Crocker’s real estate partner Henry Luken in 2010 which bailed out Luken and Corker when Luken’s real estate firm was technically in default on loans used to buy Corker’s real estate in 1999, in a transaction where Corker had contingent liability that might have thrown him into bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2014, Corker made a $1 million-plus investment in a Mobile, Alabama shopping center, just days before the project’s developers disclosed they had secured financing from Wells Fargo.\n\nSince 1994, Wells Fargo has awarded CBL up to $1.26 billion, making Wells Fargo a major lender – a relationship that was affirmed most recently in October 2015, when Wells helped CBL secure a credit facility of $1 billion and close a new $350 million term loan.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, the Campaign for Accountability (CFA) filed a complaint with the SEC and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics alleging that Croker concealed information about his stake in several hedge funds managed by his campaign donors in violation of federal laws and Senate Rules.\n\nThe CFA complaint alleged that between 2013 and 2015, Corker failed to disclose the underlying assets in at least six hedge funds from which he had received at least $2 million in income, in violation of Senate rules.\n\nCFA Executive Director Anne Weismann said, “Sen. Corker hasn’t just made a mockery of Senate disclosure rules, he may have committed a crime. Authorities should investigate why Sen. Corker was so intent on hiding the underlying assets of these funds that he filed inaccurate disclosure forms year after year.”\n\nOn Dec. 13, 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported Corker had failed to disclose millions of dollars of income from real estate, hedge funds and other investments since entering the Senate in 2007, according to revised financial reports filed by the Tennessee Republican – despite Corker then serving as the third-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the real-estate and financial-services sectors.\n\nIn a letter dated March 29, 2007, Corker rounded up four other U.S. Senators, including Virginia Democrat Sen. Mark Warner to write a letter to Melvin Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nThe letter asked President Trump to continue taking what is known as the “Net Worth Sweep” that sweeps all Freddie and Fannie earnings into the U.S. Treasury, without paying stockholders any dividends.\n\nIn their appeal to Watt, Corker and Warner argued that if the Trump administration stopped the NWS, Fannie and Freddie would be allowed to recapitalize, something Congress envisioned in the 2008 decision to place Freddie and Fannie in a conservatorship.\n\nBut Corker and Warner do not want Freddie and Fannie to recapitalize because this would be directly counter to the “housing finance reform” legislation Corker and Warner have co-sponsored since 2013.\n\nThat legislation aims to complete the Obama administration plan to shut down Fannie and Freddie, handing over all U.S. mortgage finance to Wall Street and to big banks, including Wells Fargo and UBS.\n\nCorker and Warner, with their proposed legislation, have schemed to advance what leaked Geithner-era Treasury documents published by Infowars.com proves there was an Obama administration plan to end “home ownership” as part of the American Dream.\n\nThese leaked documents show Obama’s Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner lead a series among Obama administration officials and outside real estate “experts” that were closed to the press, aiming to “wind down” Fannie and Freddie, knowing full well that closing Fannie and Freddie would turn the U.S. middle class into a nation of “well-housed” renters, on the model of the European Union.", "title": "GOP Senator Gets Rich Blocking Obamacare Repeals  Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!", "url": "https://www.infowars.com/gop-senator-gets-rich-blocking-obamacare-repeals/", "main": "http://www.infowars.com", "fact": "LOW"}

According to a spokesperson for The German Federal Network Agency, the government will not at this time \"instigate any regulatory proceedings against the parents\". The spokesperson stated in an email response,\n\n\" The Bundesnetzagentur is assuming that parents will take it upon themselves to make sure the doll does not pose a risk. There are no plans at present to instigate any regulatory proceedings against the parents.\" In our view, it is sufficient to remove the microphone from the doll.\n\nClick here to see a formal press release regarding the initial story about the \"My Friend Cayla\" doll.\n\n(Previously reported) A talking doll has the German government threatening to fine parents over $25,000 if they don't kill it. It may sound like the trailer to a horror film about demon possessed dolls, but The German Federal Network Agency made it's decision after smart dolls were allegedly found to be transmitting audio recordings to a third party specializing in voice recognition to police and military forces. This story raises more than one flag, the safety of children is also also at risk here.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that The German Federal Network Agency has ordered parents to destroy any “My Friend Cayla” dolls that their children have, or face more than $25,000 in fines for not complying. This ruling comes after the smart dolls were found to be transmitting audio recordings to a third party specializing in voice recognition for police and military forces.\n\nNot only does the unique doll speak, but it uses speech-to-text protocols to be able to have conversations with the children. While children may enjoy the fun capabilities to interact with them, the listening functionality leaves the doll open to hacking. Anyone who has access to a valid version of the doll’s connected mobile app can access the toy via Bluetooth.\n\nThe FNA, Germany’s telecommunications network, first raised the problem of the dolls back in February, instructing parents to destroy it for containing a “concealed transmitting device.” Fox News reported then that the German distributor of talking doll My Friend Cayla assured it is safe to use. The report reads in part,\n\nThe distributor of a talking doll which has been banned in Germany due to security concerns insists it is not an \"espionage device\".\n\nReportedly after some more research the agency is now taking the extra step of completely banning the sale, purchase, and ownership of the dolls. Stefan Hessel, a law student who helped formulate the FNA’s legal opinion to ban the doll, told the Wall Street Journal that\n\n“it’s pretty bad bringing a doll on the market anybody in a 30-feet radius can connect to… A regular Bluetooth loudspeaker is better protected.”\n\nBreitbart News reports that parents have been instructed to fill out a certificate of destruction of the doll and have it signed by a legitimate waste-management company to be sent back to the FNA for proof after the doll is destroyed. Telecommunication laws in Germany leave open a potential fine of $26,500 and two years in prison as a general punishment for not following FNA directives. There are conflicting reports about who the manufacturer of the doll is, but Genesis Toys appears to be a leading designer.\n\nWall Street Journal copy / Breitbart News / TRUNEWS contribution.\n\nPlease contact TRUNEWS with any news tips related to this story.

{"category": "Conspiracy-Pseudoscience", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "April 19, 2017\n\nPope Francis on Wednesday offered a reflection on Christ’s Resurrection and the start of Christianity, saying it’s not about us and what we do, but what the Lord has done for us. In his weekly “General Audience” before thousands of pilgrims Wednesday, the Pope underscored the interpersonal aspect of Christianity as faith in the person of Jesus Christ as savior and revealer of the Father. He emphasized that Christianity is not so much our search for God, but rather God's search for us.\n\nIn his recent sermon Pope Francis has refuted the idea of Christianity as a philosophy or political ideology, proposing rather that it is a journey of faith with its roots in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. The words directly confront any Easter season criticism suggesting that Christianity is anything else but real. Reflecting on the witness of Saint Paul, Francis noted that Christian faith is not the outcome of a reflection of some wise person, but a simple fact that intervened in the lives of some people.\n\n“Paul sums it up this way: Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day he rose again and appeared to Peter and to the Twelve,” the Pope said. “This is the fact: he died, was buried, is risen and has appeared. That is, Jesus is alive!” “This is the core of the Christian message,” Francis said.\n\nThe Pope insisted that Christ’s resurrection was central to the preaching of the early Christian community, because it highlighted the sense that death did not have the final word. If everything were over with Christ’s death, Francis reasoned, he would have given an example of supreme dedication, but he would not move us to faith in Him. He would have been one more hero to admire.\n\n“No!” Francis said. “He died but rose again.”\n\nTo those calling themselves Christians but do not believe in the Jesus' resurrection, Faith, he said,\n\n“is born from the resurrection. To accept that Christ died on the cross is not an act of faith; it is a historical fact. Believing that he rose, on the other hand, is an act of faith.” The Christian faith “was born on Easter morning,” Francis asserted.\n\nCatholic News Agency / Breitbart News / TRUNEWS contribution.\n\nPlease contact TRUNEWS with any news tips related to this story.

Death penalty critics say that attempts to use substitute drugs made by lightly-regulated companies, meanwhile, have created quality control issues.\n\nThis week, a convoluted legal battle unfolded in Arkansas over the state's plan to execute eight convicts in 11 days. The rushed schedule was prompted by the expiration at the end of April of the state's supply of the Valium-like sedative midazolam, which is used to sedate prisoners before death. The drug has been linked to several botched executions.\n\nAll death-penalty states call for lethal injection as the primary method of killing, in part because the U.S. Supreme Court has twice affirmed its legality despite claims from death row inmates that it can cause needless pain.\n\nIn response to the sales ban, several states have weighed other options, both old, such as firing squads, and new, such as nitrogen gas. In the past, some states used gas chambers filled with hydrogen cyanide.\n\nDefense lawyers, however, would likely challenge those options as violating the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, starting with whether the procedure posed a risk of unnecessary pain.\n\n\"The first thing we would review is the protocol that is in place, and look at other executions by that method by other states to determine whether or not there have been problems,\" said Dale Baich, a federal defender in Arizona who has worked on numerous death penalty appeals.\n\nCourts have generally seen newer forms of execution like lethal injection as more humane, potentially making it difficult for states to argue that older methods like firing squads are better, said Richard Jaffe, an Alabama lawyer who has defended 60 people facing the death penalty.\n\nUnlike lethal injection, courts have not recently grappled with the legality of alternative methods. The Supreme Court ruled the firing squad was constitutional nearly 140 years ago, for instance.\n\nKent Scheidegger, legal director of the nonprofit Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports capital punishment, said death penalty critics had pressured drug companies into cutting off the supply of drugs, thereby causing problematic executions when states turn to inferior drugs.\n\nScheidegger said he favors the use of nitrogen gas as an alternative if lethal injection drugs are unavailable, noting that it is used every day by veterinarians as a way of putting animals down painlessly.\n\n\"I don't think murderers deserve a painless death, frankly,\" Scheidegger said. \"But as far as removing obstacles from getting these sentences carried out, I think that's the way to go.\"\n\nSeven states permit the use of secondary methods if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or if the necessary drugs are unavailable, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nSix other states allow inmates to choose another way of dying, such as a firing squad, hanging or electrocution.\n\n\"If we shift to another method, that guarantees litigation,\" said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University who has studied capital punishment.\n\nA number of states have effectively halted executions because of concerns over the process. Since 2015, only seven states have successfully put prisoners to death, with Texas accounting for 24 of 54 executions.\n\nMississippi approved a law this month permitting the use of nitrogen gas as an alternative. Oklahoma became the first state to do so in 2015, and Alabama lawmakers are considering similar legislation. But that procedure has not been tested.\n\n\"If they tried nitrogen, I am sure there will be challenges to that because that method is another experiment,\" Arizona federal defender Baich said.\n\nReuters copy/TRUNEWS contribution", "title": "Legal hurdles for States pursing alternative ways to execute", "url": "http://www.trunews.com/article/legal-hurdles-for-states-pursing-alternative-ways-to-execute", "main": "http://www.trunews.com", "fact": "LOW"}

Our locators were the first to go out, and then the whole Aegis went out. The pride of our fleet became our shame! The US military didn’t know that the Russian aircraft was equipped with the latest electronic warfare complex Khibiny.”\n\nThe report quoted the now-retired U.S. Air Force General Frank Gorenc, who served as the commander of all America air assets in Europe and Africa on his last assignment, as saying:\n\n“Russian electronic weapons completely paralyze the functioning of American electronic equipment installed on missiles, aircraft and ships.”\n\nIn 2014, Veterans Today reported that the USS Donald Cook lost power after a close flyover by a Russian Su-24 bomber while on mission in the Black Sea, and was subsequently rushed to a port in Romania.\n\nAccording to Retired Russian Major General Pavel Zolotarev, who serves as the Deputy Director for the Institute of USA and Canada, and was quoted in the VT report, the Su-24 used an advanced “radio-electronic jamming system” code named “Khibiny” to disable the cruisers radars and Aegis defense system used to launch Tomahawk missiles.\n\nZolotarvev added some detail to why the system was nicknamed “Khibiny”:\n\n“This is the name of the mountain range on the Kola Peninsula in the Arctic Circle. “Khibiny” is the newest complex for radioelectronic jamming of the enemy. They will be installed on all the advanced Russian planes.”\n\nThe U.S. military has employed a similar technology in both Iraq and Afghanistan to neutralize radio activated improvised explosive devices (IED), with a device installed on military patrol vehicles which jam both incoming and outgoing cellular signals.\n\nIn addition to the mobile jamming system, the Vesti report also showed how the system can be used to disable incoming missiles, and defend an area from satellite surveillance penetration.\n\nNearly all NATO’s advanced weaponry, radar, and tracking systems rely heavily on satellite connectivity and signal preservation.

The church runs a preschool and daycare center.\n\nThe case, which tests the limits of religious freedom under the U.S. Constitution, is considered one of the most important to come before the court during its current term.\n\nThe church, whose legal effort was spearheaded by the Alliance Defending Freedom conservative Christian activist group, could be headed for a lopsided win, with liberals Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer joining their conservative colleagues in hinting at their support.\n\n\"It seems to me ... this is a clear burden on a constitutional right,\" said Kagan in reference to the state prohibition.\n\nTrinity Lutheran has argued that Missouri's policy violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law.\n\nBreyer questioned whether denying churches access to the playground grant money would be akin to refusing to provide police or fire services. \"What's the difference?\" Breyer said.\n\nConservative Justice Samuel Alito noted that there are several federal grant programs open to religious entities, including one that provides money to enhance security at buildings where there is a risk of terrorist attack.\n\nJustice Gorsuch signaled support for the church by asking Layton why it is acceptable for Missouri to discriminate against religious entities in some instances, such as with the playground program, but not in other circumstances, including the provision of safety and health services.\n\nA victory at the Supreme Court for Trinity Lutheran could help religious organizations nationwide win public dollars for certain purposes, such as health and safety. It also could buttress the case for using taxpayer money for vouchers to help pay for children to attend religious schools rather than public schools in \"school choice\" programs advocated by conservatives.\n\nTrinity Lutheran sued in federal court in 2012. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015 upheld a trial court's dismissal of the suit, and the church appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nSupreme Court Rules against Religious Liberties\n\nUS Supreme Court: Transgender Bathroom in Schools\n\nRick Wiles: Can Trump Dump the Federal Court System?\n\nReuters copy, TRUNEWS contribution\n\nPlease contact TRUNEWS correspondent Edward Szall with any news tips related to this story.\n\nEmail: Edward.Szall@trunews.com | Twitter: @realEdwardSzall DOWNLOAD THE TRUNEWS MOBILE APP on Apple and Google Play!\n\n", "title": "Supreme Court sympathetic in Missouri religious freedom case", "url": "http://www.trunews.com/article/supreme-court-sympathetic-in-missouri-religious-freedom-case", "main": "http://www.trunews.com", "fact": "LOW"}

{"category": "Conspiracy-Pseudoscience", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "Clinging to magical-thinking fixes that change nothing on the fundamental level hastens collapse.\n\nHere we stand on the precipice, and all we have in our kit is a collection of delusional magical thinking that we label \"solutions.\" We are not just morally and financially bankrupt, we're intellectually bankrupt as well.\n\nHere are three examples of magical thinking that pass for intellectually sound ideas:\n\n1. Mainstream neo-classical/ Keynesian economics. As economist Manfred Max-Neef notes in this interview, neo-classical/ Keynesian economics is no longer a discipline or a science--it is a religion.\n\nIt demands a peculiar faith in nonsense: for example, the environment--Nature-- is merely a subset of the economy. When we've stripped the seas of wild fish (and totally destroyed the ecology of the oceans), no problem--we'll substitute farmed fish, which are in economic terms, entirely equal to wild fish.\n\nIn other words, the natural world cannot be valued in our current mock-science religion of economics.\n\nOther absurdities abound. Stripping the seas of wild fish adds to GDP, so it's all good, right? Dismantling newly constructed buildings and building a replacement structure also adds to GDP, so it's an excellent source of \"growth.\"\n\nAs Max-Neef points out, conventional economists have absolutely no understanding of poverty. If you need a sobering account of just how this abject willful ignorance works in the real world, I recommend reading The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good.\n\nGail Tverberg (among others) has shown how the existing economic model no longer makes sense of the actual economy we inhabit: The Economy Is Like a Circus.\n\nAs for rising wealth/income inequality--there is a cure for that, but it's not in mainstream econ textbooks: The Only Thing, Historically, That's Curbed Inequality: Catastrophe Plagues, revolutions, massive wars, collapsed states—these are what reliably reduce economic disparities.(via Arshad A.)\n\n2. Universal Basic Income. As noted in yesterday's essay, wages are no longer an adequate means of distributing the dwindling surplus of advanced economies. Wages as a share of GDP have been declining for decades, and only click up temporarily during massive speculative bubbles. Once these bubbles pop, which they inevitably do due to their instability and unsustainability, wage earners' share of GDP plummets to a new low.\n\nThe mainstream is enthusing about the \"solution\": Universal Basic Income (UBI). The solution to low pay and scarcity of middle-class paid work is to give everyone a basic income for doing nothing.\n\nDelusional academics anticipate a flowering of creative talent akin to a new Renaissance as people are freed from work by robots and automation. But if we look at people already receiving the equivalent of \"free money\" UBI--disability-- studies find recipients are simply watching more TV and YouTube videos and pursuing opioids, not writing poetry and composing concertos.\n\nThey are not volunteering in their community or engaging their communities in any positive fashion. What actually happens with UBI is recipients become isolated and miserable because UBI strips their lives of meaning, purpose and the need to contribute to a community.\n\nThe real purpose of UBI is to chain every household to the state, and drain all social relations between the isolated \"consumer\" and the state.\n\nAs tragic as the delusion of UBI is to individuals, it is unworkable financially because profits will fall as automation becomes commoditized, and the surplus available to distribute to every household will diminish.\n\nI explain this at some length in my books Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform and A Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology & Creating Jobs for All.\n\nMuch of what is passed off as \"corporate profits\" is accounting fraud and the monetization of what was once free. For example, all that customer labor: now that we pump our own gasoline, check and pack our own purchases, do our own banking--who's skimming the output of our labor? Yup, the corporations.\n\nCommoditization of software and tools + the Internet = loss of monopoly. This is a problem, for the core function of the state-cartel version of capitalism we inhabit is the state enforces a cartel-monopoly structure to guarantee steady surpluses it can tax for its own expansion.\n\nAs automation is commoditized, profits plummet as competition can no longer be controlled by cartels or even the state--just as Marx laid out.\n\nCombine declining productivity and declining surplus (profits) (both for deeply structural reasons) and there cannot be enough money to fund UBI. Weirdly, proponents of UBI never even perform a back of the envelope calculation of cost and the source of all this free money (tax revenues and/or borrowing from future generations). Perhaps they intuit that such an exercise would reveal the bankruptcy of their magical thinking.\n\nAs we shall see below, the system can't even support the entitlements it has already promised to hundreds of millions of people, never mind an additional universal entitlement.\n\n(Note to UBI enthusiasts: there are limits on what robots and automation can and will do: they will only perform work that is highly profitable. Since most human work is not profitable (or even paid), the idea that robots and automation will free everyone from work is delusional fantasy. I explain all this in greater detail in A Radically Beneficial World.)\n\n3. Medicare for all. I understand the desire for a single-payer healthcare system, and have published various proposals over the years for such a system.\n\nThe latest magical-thinking \"solution\" attracting widespread support (again, without any basis in actual numbers) is Medicare for all. The idea is: take a system (Medicare-Medicaid) that's already bankrupting the government and the nation and expand it from 70 million people to 320 million people.\n\nUh, right.\n\nShall we consult reality before embracing delusional \"solutions\"? Here's a chart of the rise of administrative costs in healthcare, public and private. Proponents of Medicare for All claim admin costs are lower in Medicare, but this conveniently overlooks the estimates that 40% of Medicare costs are paper-shuffling, needless or harmful tests, procedures, etc. and outright fraud.\n\nWe know a few things as fact. One is that the populations qualifying for Medicare and Medicaid (the elderly and low-income households) are expanding at a high and very predictable rate.\n\nThe other thing we know is that the Medicare-Medicaid costs are rising at a rate far above the growth rate of the economy that supports these programs (GDP), far above the growth rate of tax revenues and far above the growth rate of wages, which matters because payroll taxes fund Medicare.\n\nIt doesn't take much to extend these lines and conclude Medicare-Medicaid alone will bankrupt the federal government and the nation. The problem is these programs are bloated by fraud, defensive medicine, predatory pricing for medications, and every other costly ill of our healthcare system.\n\nLike every other centrally funded/regulated sector, Medicare-Medicaid is optimized for maximizing private-sector profits and increasing regulatory costs.This is one manifestation of the diminishing returns on the entire centralized-control model:\n\nWe'd all like \"solutions\" that don't change anything, but when the system itself is the source of our problems, changing nothing guarantees collapse. As noted in the article linked above, various inequalities and asymmetries get resolved by collapse.\n\nClinging to magical-thinking fixes that change nothing on the fundamental level hastens collapse. In that sense, magical-thinking fixes are \"solutions,\" but not the sort their proponents imagined.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you found value in this content, please join me in seeking solutions by becoming a $1/month patron of my work via patreon.com.\n\nCheck out both of my new books, Inequality and the Collapse of Privilege ($3.95 Kindle, $8.95 print) and Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform ($3.95 Kindle, $8.95 print, $5.95 audiobook) For more, please visit the OTM essentials website.", "title": "The \"Religion\" of Economics, UBI and Medicare For All", "url": "http://www.blacklistednews.com/Our_Intellectual_Bankruptcy%3A_The_%22Religion%22_of_Economics%2C_UBI_and_Medicare_For_All/58016/0/38/38/Y/M.html", "main": "http://www.blacklistednews.com", "fact": "MIXED"}
{"category": "Conspiracy-Pseudoscience", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "As the United States positions fresh military assets near the Korean peninsula and reports emerge that China has positioned 150,000 troops at the border of North Korea, there appears to be a strong shift away from the longstanding policy of secretly opposing reunification of the two Koreas supported by factions within the West and China. This policy was outlined in paid speeches Hillary Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013 which were released by Wikileaks in late 2016 during the presidential election. The record gives an interesting glimpse into a policy which has now been all but totally reversed by political developments over the past several years.\n\nI. The U.S. Has Historically Opposed Korean Reunification In Secret\n\nThe Goldman Sachs speeches focused on economic and financial issues. However, they also showed a foreign policy approach now totally altered by geopolitical changes in China, the United States and the Koreas themselves. In the first of a series of three speeches, Clinton made an substantial revelation: the United States has secretly opposed Korean reunification, since such a development would result in South Korea becoming dominant economically and politically.\n\nThe speech further mentioned that the United States opted instead to maintain a balance with North Korean leadership, keeping the peninsula in a state of political flux. The death of Kim Jong-il and his son Kim Jong-un’s assumption of power changed this equilibrium, however. Clinton’s speech in 2013 revealed an already heightened level of annoyance with the new leader’s willingness to seek confrontation not just with traditional enemies such as South Korea, Japan and the United States but also their strongest ally, China.\n\nII. Xi Jinping Has Reined In Support For A Belligerent North Korea\n\nClinton further revealed that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was traditionally one of the main sources of support for North Korea, given the deep connections between the countries’ two militaries. Chinese President Xi Jinping changed this culture of support, reining in individuals as part of a drive to reduce corruption and consolidate power with the aim of facilitating a Chinese shift to focus on expansion into other areas of the world, such as Africa and the South China Sea. Diplomatic cables from 2009 released by Wikileaks revealed increasing Chinese annoyance with North Korea, who they referred to in private as a “spoiled child.” One year later, a cable indicated that officials within the Chinese government were ready to accept a reunified Korea that was benign and anchored to the United States diplomatically, since this would provide trade and labor-export opportunities for Chinese companies as well as marginalize their regional opponent, Japan.\n\nXi’s cleanup of the PLA appears to be twofold: including them in his widely touted campaign against corruption while also showing the PLA special attention by upgrading their capabilities and increasing investment in the military. On April 24th, 2016, The Wall Street Journalreported on Xi’s drive to upgrade the military in a politically ambitious plan that would come to fruition by 2020. The shift would end Chinese policies of isolationism that have lasted since the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century and would see China’s military used in theaters such as the Middle East and Africa. The increased investment comes at the same time that Xi replaced the PLA’s vice chairman of the Central Military Commission in March 2017, a move that many observers saw as an effort to clean up corruption and consolidate Beijing’s control of the PLA.\n\nChina has also engaged in increasingly harsh rhetoric towards North Korea. On April 10th, 2017, South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported that China had issued a strong warning against North Korea over any intended nuclear tests the country might have planned. The next day, ZeroHedge noted that a tabloid run by Communist Party-controlled People’s Daily had issued a strongly worded ultimatum threatening military action should North Korea engage in any nuclear tests that affected the “stability and security” of northeast China (the article has since been removed from the tabloid’s web page). Such language suggests that China is perhaps finally ready to cooperate in reaching a lasting solution to the Korean conflict.\n\nIII. China And The United States’ Shift On North Korea Comes After Political Turnover In The South\n\nThe move to take stronger action against North Korea comes in the immediate aftermath of a political scandal that has rocked South Korea and disrupted the influence of state and private foreign actors in the country. On March 31st, 2017, Disobedient Media reported on the arrest of South Korean President Park Geun-hye, which also led to the indictment of Samsung Group leader Lee Jae-yong after it emerged that he had paid 43 billion Korean won ($36.6 million) to entities connected to President Park. The Samsung Group maintained business relations with the Clinton Foundation, an obvious supporter of policies opposing Korean reunification which were outlined in Clinton’s Goldman Sachs speeches. The Samsung Group also had financial ties to the Rothschild family, who have been revealed in Wikileaks releases to have been staunch supporters of Clinton during her 2016 political run for President.\n\nPresident Park’s arrest and the disruption of Western-friendly business entities in South Korea tied to parties who oppose reunification creates a unique window for the United States and China to reverse previous policies which kept the peninsula divided. With China reining in factions who have traditionally supported the North Korean government, the opportunity to create a unified Korea has never been closer to realization. So long as both parties are able to manage the transition in a way that benefits both China and the United States politically and economically, the North Korean crisis could result in a successful exercise of bipartisan cooperation that would avoid military conflict and lay the ground for further cooperation on broader trade issues that the two countries are continuing to negotiate.", "title": "What Hillary’s Goldman Sachs Speeches Revealed About Changing Tides In The Koreas", "url": "http://www.blacklistednews.com/What_Hillary%E2%80%99s_Goldman_Sachs_Speeches_Revealed_About_Changing_Tides_In_The_Koreas/58001/0/38/38/Y/M.html", "main": "http://www.blacklistednews.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

{"category": "Conspiracy-Pseudoscience", "date": "None", "authors": [], "content": "US President Donald Trump was the first (and so far, to the best of our knowledge, only) Western leader to congratulate his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday on acquiring virtually dictatorial powers. But while the commanders-in-chief of NATO’s two largest armies may share a common authoritarian impulse, Trump may yet come to see Erdogan as a bad role model. Experts say the Turkish president’s proclamation of victory in Sunday’s referendum could bring short-term stability in NATO’s Middle Eastern anchor, but the future of this deeply divided country looks far from stable.\n\nOn Tuesday night, hundreds gathered under a drizzle for a third evening in a row in the central areas of Istanbul and other Turkish cities. They were responding to widespread claims of fraud in the vote that granted Erdogan’s sweeping executive powers. The protests appeared to be growing, having spread to some 11 cities and 30 locations on Tuesday, an opposition media activist told WhoWhatWhy.\n\nThe European Commission on Tuesday urged “transparent investigations.” The main opposition filed for an annulment of the referendum, maintaining that at least 1.5 million unstamped ballots had been deemed valid in a breach of established procedure. According to a Reuters report, that number could be as high as 2.5 million. In comparison, the “Yes” campaign won by just 1.3 million votes, or 51.4% against 48.6%, according to the latest, still-unofficial results.\n\n“Late changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard [of the authenticity of the vote],” the OSCE elections watchdog reported in a press conference on Monday afternoon. Charging that the referendum “did not live up to Council of Europe standards,” the report noted that voting “took place on an unlevel playing field and the two sides of the campaign did not have equal opportunities.”\n\nThere was little unbiased media reporting inside the country, whose mainstream media have been largely taken over by the government; even the physical safety of “No” campaigners was at times compromised.\n\n\n\nCHP Spox: despite 100+ workers from 3 Kurdish villages being elsewhere for work, their ballot boxes were 100% full: https://t.co/WFdzLj2tqe — Ankaralı Jan (@06JAnk) April 17, 2017\n\nSocial media are abuzz with alleged evidence of fraud; a prominent pollster said he was leaving the business because either the vote was rigged or he was incompetent, and in either case “there is no sense in doing polls.”\n\n“I’m 100% sure that the results are tainted,” he added in an interview with the daily Hurriyet.\n\nStill, few appear to believe that much would come of the complaints lodged by the opposition parties, since the government controls the courts. The protests, which have so far attracted crowds in the hundreds, are also unlikely to challenge Erdogan: the police are out in force and people here have vivid memories of the 2013 Gezi Park mass protests, which were brutally crushed.\n\n“My prediction is that Turkey will consolidate its authoritarianism,” an Oxford University researcher who is performing a field study in Turkey and asked not to be identified, told WhoWhatWhy.\n\nBut Erdogan, who responded to the OSCE preliminary report by accusing the watchdog of a “crusader mentality,” has few reasons to celebrate. He needs to stay in power in order to continue to suppress a corruption investigation that he stopped in its tracks by firing police and prosecutors in 2014. Following a failed coup last year, Erdogan is reportedly dependent on a group of nationalist army and security officers sympathetic to Russia. (WhoWhatWhy wrote more extensively about his insecurities and dilemmas in the run-up to the election in a separate article.)\n\nThe Oxford researcher added that the outcome of the referendum was not only a bitter irony for the ruling AKP party, which started off in the 2000s as a moderate Islamist anti-authoritarian project, but also a blow to stability in the entire Middle East, where moderate Islamist movements seeking to challenge homegrown dictatorial regimes have long held up Turkey as a role model.\n\n“What we’ve seen over the past five or so years in Turkey, is that Turkey has been in a transitional period of de-democratization, and those transitional periods are quite unstable, regardless of whether a country is moving towards or away from democracy,” the researcher said.\n\n“And when a country exits from that period of transition and consolidates itself, either as a democracy or as a dictatorship, it often appears, at least on the surface, as more stable. But how sustainable is that stability… when it rides on the back of tearing apart Turkey’s social fabric? I think the smart money says, that’s not sustainable stability.”\n\nWhile government supporters celebrated and cheered on the streets, their joy was diminished because for the first time in over 20 years, Erdogan lost in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, where he started his political career as mayor.\n\nThe “No” vote also carried Turkey’s two other major cities, the capital Ankara and the opposition bastion of Izmir. Many of the “Yes” votes came from smaller towns and remote areas where it was more difficult to observe the ballot boxes.\n\nVIDEO: Mass anti referendum fraud protest in Istanbul's Kadikoy. pic.twitter.com/6VM7irI2rZ — Turkey Untold (@TurkeyUntold) April 17, 2017\n\nCan Dundar, a prominent Erdogan critic and former editor-in-chief of the Cumhuriyet newspaper, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of revealing state secrets, spoke to Die Welt from his exile in Germany. He said it was a “Pyrrhic victory” — meaning that the cost of the victory was so great it is tantamount to defeat. He also said it is “the beginning of the end of the Erdogan era” if the opposition can maintain its unity. Opposition activists on the ground offered similar perspectives.\n\nErdogan won’t be able to assume his full executive powers until the next presidential election, scheduled for 2019. A key topic to watch between now and then would be the Turkish economy, whose boom during the early period of Erdogan’s 15-year rule, as the Oxford researcher put it, was the most logically sound reason people voted “Yes.” (The researcher listed two others: blind faith in the leader and belief in anti-Western conspiracy theories.)\n\n\n\nBut the economic boom that Turkey enjoyed back when Erdogan was still a democrat praised by the West has since fizzled. Today, experts say the Turkish economy is in serious trouble, despite possible short-term gains fueled by the promise of stability.\n\nTurkey has been on Morgan Stanley’s list of “Fragile Five” emerging economies, those most in danger of a currency crisis, all the way since 2013. The US dollar has gone up about 30% against the local currency in the past year, piling pressure on businesses whose debts are denominated in foreign currencies. Though the Turkish economy grew some 2.9% in 2016, beating the expectations of many analysts, the latest data, released on Monday, showed that unemployment hit a seven-year-high in January, at 13%.\n\n\n\nCenk Sidar of Sidar Global Advisors, a Washington, D.C.-based strategic advisory firm, explained in an email to WhoWhatWhy shortly before the vote: “Turkey has been facing various structural problems, including but not limited to high unemployment, a high current account deficit, and unsustainable dependence on foreign capital inflows. … Bad foreign policy decisions, erosion of institutions, mistrust in the judiciary system, and a growing tilt toward authoritarianism have all contributed to the current poor performance of the lira.”\n\nOther weaknesses include an excessive reliance on consumption and low value-added sectors such as construction.\n\n“Economic growth can only be achieved by reforms that increase productivity, rather than policies that boost demand,” the Turkish Industry and Business Association said in a statement on Monday.

Luckenbaugh kicked Christopher Siennick, who was handcuffed and seated on the sidewalk for flipping the bird to the pair of troopers.\n\nAs The Free Thought Project reported, Luckenbaugh was convicted in February of the brutal attack. This week, he learned his fate as the judge sentenced the former state trooper for his crimes. Luckenbaugh will serve between 9 and 22 months in county prison for kicking the helpless man. Fellow troopers turned in their colleague after they realized he’d crossed the line. Siennick had called the troopers a bunch of “Storm Troopers” and it was apparently enough to set off the law enforcement officer who snapped and kicked him.\n\nAt the sentencing, Luckenbaugh pleaded for leniency saying the whole ordeal and a related lawsuit had nearly bankrupted him. Pleading for leniency, he said not only did he lose his job as a state trooper but he said he’s now forced to wash dishes for a living and going to prison would be an unnecessary hardship on his family. Judge Scott A. Evans responded to Luckenbaugh’s pleas for leniency by saying, “I didn’t put them here today,” he said indicating the trooper’s actions that day resulted in the loss of his job and his prison sentence.\n\nAccording to Penn Live, “Luckenbaugh issued a ‘very sincere, heartfelt’ apology to Siennick “for failing to serve him in a respectful, dignified manner.'” Siennick passed when he was given an opportunity to speak his peace and address the former state trooper directly.\n\nHowever, Senior Deputy District Attorney Stephen Zawisky had a lot to say about Luckenbaugh’s actions. He said it wasn’t the kick to the face which was the most damaging. He said it was the fact, proven in court, that Luckenbaugh lied about the incident on his police report, an action which has undermined the overall trust in the justice system. The lie led to Siennick being unjustly jailed for 14 days.\n\n“This case is not about a kick. It’s about a lie…(which)…results in distrust of law enforcement in general,” he said. “That destroys the criminal justice system. Courts rely on honesty to work,” he added. Defense attorneys will no doubt be looking at Luckenbaugh’s prior cases to determine if proving he lied in those cases will help to free their clients.\n\nZawisky addressed the media and made the following statement. “It’s bittersweet, the verdict,” he said. “It certainly is going to make my job…and the police officer out on the street, a lot harder…but it was a just verdict,” he concluded. Luckenbaugh seemed contrite when he made the following statement to the court. “I stand here as a much more humble, simple man,” he said. “I acknowledge my faults and failures,” he added accepting responsibility for his actions.\n\nJudge Evans, not wanting to neglect an excellent opportunity to praise law enforcement apparently, addressed Luckenbaugh’s fellow officers and extended his gratitude for coming forward to turn in one of their own. “Please take back to the Harrisburg Police Department not only my thanks, but my acknowledgment that the position they took in this case is commendable,” the judge said. “That took a great deal of fortitude.” Luckenbaugh begins serving his sentence on May 16.", "title": "Justice!

The rehearsal space is in the basement of a home owned by the band’s saxophone player, Tim Younessi.\n\nRehearsal was about to start when three police officers with guns drawn came barging in. The police said they were carrying out a warrant for Henry Burton, who is wanted on back child support.\n\nYounessi informed the police that no one lived there by that name, and that in fact, a similar search had already been performed about a year beforehand. The Cuyahoga County Sheriffs indicated it was not their department who conducted the previous search and ordered all present to not move until search was completed.\n\nEven though the cops were at the wrong house, they still insisted on conducting the search. They allowed Younessi to keep an eye out while they searched, although they kept all other band members in the basement under police surveillance. The search of the home, as well as the band’s tour bus, was conducted in about ten minutes, with police finding nothing.\n\nInterestingly enough, while the officers claimed there was a warrant, none was ever presented to the homeowner, and no copy was left with him. Younessi stated that although there was an aggressive nature behind the entire situation, there were no broken valuables, nothing seized and no arrests made. However, all involved feel as if their civil liberties were infringed on.\n\nYounessi purchased the home through a foreclosure sale two years ago, and is technically the second owner since Burton, the man who both warrants have been stated to be for.\n\nThe consensus of everyone involved is that one mistaken raid is a semi-understandable mistake, but definitely not condoned. After this second incident, Younessi feels that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated and someone needs to be held accountable.\n\nAfter photos and statements about the raid were posted on Facebook, many people came forward with advice on how to get justice for the situation, and the band is currently looking into what can be done to hold the Sheriff Department accountable.\n\nBelow is the Facebook post from the band.", "title": "Cops Raid Wrong House Twice, Still Conduct Search", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/gross-incompetence-cops-raid-wrong-house-twice-conduct-search/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

Although the video is short, it is clear enough to realize there is absolutely no struggle.\n\nThe video, uploaded to Instagram by Norman Marsh, starts out with him saying something that sounds like, “There is no resisting.” Within seconds, the officer snaps, grabs the window with his hands, and begins thrusting all of his body weight backward in an attempt to break the window.\n\nAfter a few tugs by the 200+ lb cop, the window meets its match and shatters. Amazingly enough, Marsh stays calm during the encounter, which adds credence to the fact that the officer’s actions were likely entirely uncalled for.\n\nMarsh then posted the video of the incident to Instagram with the following description:\n\nTalk about how it continues.. This police man just broke my damn car window for no damn reason. Good thing I got on camera.. The struggle continues!!! We won’t let them nor no one stop us from the Success we have waiting for us!!

On the right side of his vest, he is wearing the now infamous “Punisher” patch. As you see him shatter this man’s window in a fit of rage, ask yourself this question. Would you expect anything less from a cop who is wearing the logo of an anti-hero who exacts punishment in the form of murder, kidnapping, extortion, and torture on those he deems guilty in his war on crime and who essentially acts as judge, jury and executioner?\n\nTalk about how it continues..

This was only due to the fact that Marsh stated this happened in Orangeburg. This was not a statement meant to implicate OSD. We’d like to apologize to the OSD for any confusion in this matter. We have since received a response from the OSD, which reads as follows:\n\nIn regards to a video released depicting what appears to be a violent traffic stop, the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office finds this type of behavior to be despicable. We have a zero tolerance for this type of action. As regards to the article, we feel it irresponsible to assign blame to this agency by means of what is apparently the equivalent of tossing a dart at a board. This officer clearly belongs to some other agency as evidenced not only by his actions but his uniform. The uniform depicted in the video is a black Class A uniform. Our Class A uniforms are gray. A medium gray that is unmistakably not black. Out of 11 law enforcement agencies in this county as well as three university public safety agencies, the blame was laid at our door without an inquiry as to the identity of either the agency nor the officer. We find that as unacceptable as the actions in this video.\n\nThe Free Thought Project reached out to both Marsh and the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s department but have yet to receive a response. While the reason for the stop is unknown, it is clear that Marsh was not arrested or detained for any significant amount of time as he was able to quickly post the video.\n\nThis scenario is a familiar one, however. Police officers, on numerous occasions, have broken out windows of entirely innocent people because they don’t have them rolled all the way down.\n\nDespite there being no laws on the books that require drivers to lower their windows all the way down, police officers have been seen assaulting people for it — claiming that it caused them to “fear for their safety.”\n\nCase in point: University of Central Florida College Student, Victoria King.\n\nKing was pulled over by UCFPD Officer Timothy Isaacs for a minor traffic offense – a bad tail light.\n\nThe officer became obsessed and incensed by Ms. King’s reluctance to roll down her window “all the way” to receive her bad tail light ticket.\n\nBecause King didn’t immediately prostrate herself before the almighty law enforcement officer, he then escalated the traffic stop to violence, breaking out the car window, assaulting King, and charging her with two felonies and a misdemeanor.\n\nSadly, a criminally ignorant jury sided with police in King’s case and she was found guilty of battery and resisting arrest without violence. She was sentenced to community service and probation — for being assaulted by a tyrant cop who didn’t know the law.\n\nHopefull, Marsh, if he is facing similar charges over a cop’s ignorance, he gets a jury that understands the law.", "title": "Cop Snaps, Shatters Man's Car Window With His Bare Hands 'For No Reason'", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/watch-cop-snaps-forcefully-shatters-mans-car-window-for-no-damn-reason/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

Although there was no investigation, and many high-profile individuals have called it a sham, the US has pinned the blame on Syrian president Bashar Al Assad. So, we thought it would be a good idea to remind our fellow Americans of an occasion where the federal government got away with gassing its own people, an action which, consequently, led to the deaths of 86 men, women, and children. It all came to a violent end 24 years ago today, in Texas.\n\nOur source material comes from the FBI’s own vault, which contains two files on the case against Vernon Howell, also known as David Koresh. Koresh was the leader of the “Branch Davidians Seventh Day Adventists.” According to the FBI case file, Koresh was believed to have been holding people against their will at his compound in Waco, Texas, potentially guilty of “involuntary servitude and slavery” charges.\n\nIn 1992, Child Protective Services (CPS) was called in to investigate the accusations. After a thorough investigation, CPS concluded no one was being held at the compound against their will, nor any child abuse, and the federal prosecutor, who reviewed the report, saw no reason to prosecute Koresh. On October 16th, 1992, the FBI closed the case against Koresh and the allegations he was abusing children and holding his followers against their will.\n\nStill, however, the FBI proceeded with investigating other allegations the Branch Davidians had converted semi-automatic AR-15 (assault) rifles into fully automatic ones, a violation of federal law. Also alleged was that the group was planning a mass suicide. The FBI concluded, “no information has been developed to verify the accuracy of the allegations.” Still, the FBI put local law enforcement on notice.\n\nDespite having no concrete evidence Koresh, who some have said was delusional, had violated anyone’s civil rights, or abused any children, the investigation into the weapons violations continued. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives pursued the allegations the group was stockpiling weapons and explosives. According to the ATF, the bureau found:\n\n136 FIREARMS, INCLUDING ASSAULT RIFLES AND HANDGUNS 700+ MAGAZINES FOR THOSE FIREARMS 200,000+ ROUNDS OF VARIOUS AMMUNITION 110 UPPER AND LOWER RECEIVERS FOR AR15/M16 RIFLES GRENADE-LAUNCHER ATTACHMENTS FOR AR15/M16 RIFLES 400+ EMPTY M31 RIFLE GRENADES, ALONG WITH BLACK POWDER AND OTHER EXPLOSIVE CHEMICALS\n\nWishing to further investigate the compound’s armory, the ATF secured a search warrant and attempted to raid the compound on February 28th, 1993. The Davidians, possibly feeling they must protect their home, property, and persons from the intruders, opened fire on the federal agents, an action which led to the deaths of several ATF agents and compound members.\n\nFOUR ATF AGENTS (SA TODD MCKEEHAN, SA CONWAY LEBLEU, SA ROBERT WILLIAMS AND SA STEVEN WILLIS) WERE KILLED; 20 ATF AGENTS WOUNDED FROM GUNSHOTS OR SHRAPNEL AND 8 SUFFERED OTHER INJURIES. SIX DAVIDIANS WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY KILLED AND FOUR WOUNDED FROM GUNSHOTS, ALTHOUGH THIS COULD NOT BE FORENSICALLY PROVEN BECAUSE OF THE LATER DESTRUCTION (BY FIRE) OF THE COMPOUND.\n\nThe raid initiated a 51-day standoff with the ATF as well as the FBI. Koresh released 24 members from the compound, who were mostly children, and continued the stand-off with authorities which was broadcast daily across the country until day 51 arrived. On that day, the government brought in heavy equipment and penetrated the compound with a tank-like machine which pumped the compound full of CS Gas. What happened next, in the minds of many who saw it, can only be likened to a horror film.\n\nThe compound became ablaze with a roaring fire. The all-consuming inferno killed 76 people who were huddled inside. Later, it was determined many of those who’d perished were also shot by firearms. Researchers, who later investigated the incident, concluded federal agents were observed shooting from the compound’s grounds into the building already set ablaze by fire. While the official government narrative is those individuals committed suicide, the researchers were able to demonstrate they were likely killed by automatic weapons fired by federal agents, possibly killed as they were attempting to flee their burning compound.\n\nTo this day, the ATF maintains the fire was, “set by cult members, as law enforcement attempted to force them out by introducing tear gas into the building.” And for years, following the fiery destruction of the compound, the FBI maintained the same story line. That was until 1999, when then-Attorney General Janet Reno made the following admission, “I am very, very troubled by the information I received this week suggesting that pyrotechnic devices may have been used in the early morning hours on April the 19th, 1993, at Waco. At this time, all available indications are that the devices were not directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged several hours before the fire started, and were not the cause of the fire. Nonetheless, it is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make them available to the public and Congress.”\n\nThose facts, according to some of the survivors of the fire, who were inside at the time the fire broke out, are undeniable. They are convinced the government used incendiary devices to set ablaze the tear gas which had been pumped into the building. And they’re not alone. According to CBS News, “Independent filmmaker Michael McNulty came upon some evidence that appeared damaging to the government. He found a shell casing from a certain type of tear gas round that could start a fire – a device the Justice Department had denied using for more than six years – publicly and to Congress.” That shell casing led to Reno’s acknowledgment, but the government still has not taken full responsibility, as Reno denied the devices were used to penetrate the building. Questions still remain as to why they would be used at all.\n\nEven though it was later determined Koresh had, indeed, molested children, and was by all intents and purposes a pedophile of the worst kind, the fact remains. The government used gas on its own people which either directly or indirectly led to the deaths of 76 people. There was no international outcry. Foreign governments did not threaten to retaliate against the ATF and the FBI. Russia did not feel compelled to launch guided missiles into the Waco, TX airport. And neither should the United States.\n\nThe U.S. has no business in the affairs of Syrians. And just like in Waco, it may take years to know precisely who was responsible for gassing and killing 83 Syrians in the Idlib Province. But go ahead and believe the official government narrative if you’d like.

What sets this case apart from the myriad of other civil cases in which police officers are found responsible for killing, beating, and depriving people of their rights, is that this cop was held personally responsible — and will have to pay the victim’s family using his own assets, not the taxpayers.\n\nOn August 12, 2012, then-Little Rock Police Officer Josh Hastings, 31, and another officer were investigating a report of car break-ins. The officers attempted to box in a car occupied by the victim, Bobby Moore III, along with two other teens.\n\nHastings fired 3 rounds into the vehicle of unarmed teens, striking Moore three times, killing him.\n\nAs is the norm when police shoot into moving vehicles, Hastings claimed he feared for his life as the 15-year-old boy attempted to run over him.\n\nHowever, according to court records, the car was in reverse when Hastings fired. The other teens in the car also testified that they were trying to flee and they did not want to run the officer over.\n\nBefore the civil case this month, Hasting was tried twice in criminal court — each time on charges of manslaughter — but the juries ended in deadlock both times. After two mistrials, the prosecutors declined to go after Hastings a third time.\n\nNaturally, after the deadlocked juries, the family of Moore was shaken, feeling like they’d never see justice for their lost child. However, last Thursday, all that changed and a heartening precedent was set.\n\nAfter two days of deliberation, the unanimous verdict was returned at 3:15 pm on Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Moody Jr., filling in for presiding Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller, read aloud the verdict that awarded Moore’s mother, Sylvia Perkins, and her family $415,000.\n\nAs the Arkansas Democrat reported, Perkins cried so hard at the news of the verdict that she shook.\n\nThe court threw out the case against two others involved in the lawsuit, and Perkins was told she could file an appeal that decision.\n\n“There are times when my faith in the judicial system has been weakened,” Austin Porter Jr., co-counsel for Perkins said. “There are times when my faith in the judicial system has been strengthened. This is one of those rare times when justice has prevailed.”\n\nHastings, who is now a delivery driver, noted that he has no idea how he’ll pay the $415,000. However, it was not money that Perkins was after, it was justice.\n\nThe case has never been about money, Perkins said, adding that she just wanted the truth to come out.\n\n“It’s been five years,” she said. “Ain’t nothing going to bring him back.”\n\nAs the Free Thought Project has reported extensively, police officers, even when found at fault for their abusive actions, are almost never held personally liable. It is the taxpayers who foot the bill. However, this new trend in accountability seems to be on the rise, and will be massively more effective at curbing police brutality than any system in place right now.\n\nIn February, former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca was told he must decide whether to pay $100,000 in damages, from his own pocket — stemming from a civil lawsuit involving an inmate abuse case — or face liens on his assets.\n\nBaca’s case was the second such case in only a short time, in which cops are being forced to come out of pocket after being found at fault in a lawsuit. Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Deputy Adam Lin’s case was similar but a bit more extreme than Baca’s and Hastings, however.\n\nIn 2013, Lin spotted 19-year-old Dontrell Stephens in a “high-crime area” — the man’s own low-income neighborhood — riding a bicycle in a manner the deputy found suspicious.\n\nLin stopped the youth, who dismounted the bike with a cell phone in his hand and slowly approached the officer. Just outside the range of dash cam video, the officer shot Stephens four times — claiming he was in fear for his life — but footage and evidence clearly showed the claim to be baseless.\n\nThree of the bullets remain lodged in Stephens’ body, according to the Sun Sentinel — two in his arm and one in his spine, which left him paralyzed and dependent on a wheelchair for mobility.\n\nStephens won a massive $22.4 million settlement and U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Seltzer ruled that Lin should foot at least a portion of the bill. Last month, nearly everything this officer owned was seized to pay back Stephens — including everything from his furniture to his clothing.\n\nBoth Lin and Hastings will most assuredly think twice before shooting another unarmed teen.\n\nImagine, for a moment, the result of all police officers being held personally liable for their actions. In nearly every other profession on the planet, if someone hurts someone else while on the job, they are held liable — personally. Why can’t cops carry personal liability insurance just like doctors?\n\nAs instances of police brutality and police killings continue to be exposed, there is no doubt that the US is in dire need of reform. The simple requirement for police to be insured for personal liability is an easy fix — especially to remove repeat offenders from the force.\n\nAll too often, when a tragic death such as Tamir Rice occurs, months later we find out that the officer should have never been given a badge and a gun in the first place because of their past.

They also lamented their dependence on Iraqi defectors who made spurious claims to further the goal of regime change.\n\nIt was a grudging admission that the famous newspaper played a critical role in pushing lies and propaganda, to lead the U.S. into a ‘pre-emptive’ war of choice. Other corporate media outlets, including those in the neoconservative (i.e. The Weekly Standard) and liberal interventionist camps, apparently felt no remorse at betraying the public.\n\nTo be fair, it wasn’t all the fault of ‘patriotic’ American media. In Sept. 2002, the Bush-Cheney cabal installed a special Pentagon intelligence unit to create the web of lies and spin needed to bring forth the Iraq war drums.\n\nThe Office of Special Plans (OSP), led by Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith, used their imagination and hard-line neocon belief in “regime change” to create Iraqi WMD and ties to terror out of thin air. With the “war on terror” as an excuse and Dick Cheney as their cover, OSP bypassed normal intelligence routes and brought what they wanted straight to President Bush.\n\nIn January 2004, Mother Jones exposed the workings of this “secret Pentagon intelligence unit and of the Defense Department’s war-planning task force,” made up of “a close-knit team of ideologues who spent a decade or more hammering out plans for an attack on Iraq and who used the events of September 11, 2001, to set it into motion.”\n\nAn essential part of this operation was input from the infamous defector, Ahmed Chalabi, and the Iraqi National Congress.\n\nMother Jones reported:\n\n“According to multiple sources, Chalabi’s Iraqi National Congress sent a steady stream of misleading and often faked intelligence reports into U.S. intelligence channels. That information would flow sometimes into NESA/OSP directly, sometimes through Defense Intelligence Agency debriefings of Iraqi defectors via the Defense Human Intelligence Service, and sometimes through the INC’s own U.S.-funded Intelligence Collection Program, which was overseen by the Pentagon. The INC’s intelligence “isn’t reliable at all,” according to Vincent Cannistraro, a former CIA chief of counterterrorism. “Much of it is propaganda. Much of it is telling the Defense Department what they want to hear, using alleged informants and defectors who say what Chalabi wants them to say, [creating] cooked information that goes right into presidential and vice presidential speeches.”\n\nFast-forward to 2017, and the U.S. is backing other “rebel” groups in other Middle Eastern countries long targeted for regime change – and using bogus intel.\n\nThe 2013 sarin gas attack that killed at least 281 Syrian civilians was immediately blamed on Assad, trumpeted by Establishment media as a “red line” meaning Assad should be forcefully removed. But it turns out the chemicals most likely came from Turkish intelligence and were fired from rebel-controlled territory.\n\nSoon after President Trump made the comment that regime change in Syria was no longer the goal, the April 4, 2017 sarin gas attack took place in Khan Sheikhoun, killing at least 74 Syrian people. Yet again, American corporate media parroted the government line. No skepticism, no questioning.\n\nWith the Tomahawk missile response, Trump had finally come around to the neocon/liberal interventionist agenda – and the MSM were positively thrilled.\n\nPundits were quick to cement the narrative that ‘Assad did it’ before people could think too much, despite quickly mounting evidence that the official narrative was suspect. Former CIA agents were questioning the rationale, and then video proof emerged of evidence tampering at the chemical attack site.\n\nIn fact, an MIT weapons expert and former DoD science advisor released his analysis, saying the evidence for the April sarin gas attack was tampered with or staged. Theodore Postol stated that the White House’s supposed proof “does not provide any evidence whatsoever that the US government has concrete knowledge that the government of Syria was the source of the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun.”\n\nThe parallels are easy to draw between Syrian war propaganda and Iraq war propaganda, and no less troubling in their potential to draw the U.S. into launching another “regime change” invasion. Countless lives lost and unimaginable destruction.\n\nNeocons and liberal interventionists are gnashing their teeth at the prospect of bringing Syria into the Western fold through military might.\n\nThe Wolfowitz of today appears to be National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster – a darling of the neocon cabal and “golden child” of disgraced General David Petraeus. It was recently revealed that McMaster is “manipulating intelligence reports given to President Donald Trump” and “seeking to involve the U.S. in a full scale war in Syria” with 150,000 American ground troops.\n\nMcMaster may not have the Office of Special Plans (or he may have something else entirely), but the threat of bogus intelligence to justify full-scale war is just as real.\n\nIf the mainstream media have an ounce of credibility, they will begin questioning the government narrative instead of immediately reporting it as fact. We cannot be led into another war based on government propaganda and the abandonment of skepticism.", "title": "Govt & Media Doing Exact Same Thing It Did To Start Iraq War, And Americans are Buying It", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/govt-media-doing-exact-same-thing-it-did-to-start-iraq-war-and-americans-are-buying-it/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

However, when three police officers are arrested, in three separate incidents, by their brothers in blue, on the same night, in the same town, it becomes newsworthy.\n\nSan Antonio Police Officers Gena Rodriguez, Harold Thomaston were arrested within hours of each other Friday night, and then a Bexar County sheriff’s deputy Sabrina Moreno was arrested by yet another SAPD officer. In all, three officers were arrested on the same night by SAPD officers. According to WWLP:\n\nPolice say Rodriguez is an 11-year veteran and was driving with her three kids in the car when she rear-ended another car. When an officer arrived to the accident, he said Rodriguez was slurring her speech, smelled like alcohol and was unsteady on her feet. A few hours later, 20-year San Antonio police veteran, Harold Thomaston was pulled over. Police say he swerved into the lane of a fellow SAPD officer, then ran a red light.\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said he was “extremely disappointed” in his officer but commended the SAPD for doing their jobs and ensuring those officers are held to the same standards as the rest of the general population.\n\nHe said, “I am extremely proud of those officers that made the right calls last night and did what they had to do in spite of their own personal feelings, in spite of whatever else may have been going on, they did their job and I am proud that we have officers like that on the streets that are willing to make that sacrifice.”\n\nSan Antonio Police Chief William McManus said, “Anytime an officer gets arrested for anything it’s disappointing, but DWI is just so, so preventable, and there is really no excuse for it.”\n\nThe smear on the SAPD comes just months after one of its deputies made headlines for offering a feces filled sandwich to a homeless man. Matthew Lockhurst, was fired from his position as a law enforcement officer after the prank, which was really no prank at all. A fellow officer forced Lockhurst to return to the homeless man and dispose of the feces sandwich, but it didn’t stop Lockhurst from continuing to smear the name of good police officers everywhere.\n\nWhile working at a duty station, he reportedly used feces to smear a streak all along the toilet seat inside the female officers’ restroom, after a fellow female officer requested the sanitary services remain clean at all times. The ‘joke’ was apparently in retaliation for her insistence on bathroom cleanliness.\n\nAs TFTP reported, Lockhurst now realizes he made a mistake saying, “This has taught me to stop acting childish and making stupid baseless jokes,” Luckhurst wrote in a statement to investigators. “I need to stop the pranks and juvenile jokes to get arise (sic) or reaction from fellow officers and friends.” He was fired after the second stain on the SAPD.\n\nSAPD cops have a terrible track record when it comes to corruption and abuse.\n\nPreviously, the Free Thought Project brought you the story of SAPD officer Serena Botello whose GPS was also used to show her negligence, exposing the fact that she had refused to do her job, not once, not 5 times, not 15 times, but 23 times in just a two-month period.\n\nOne of these 23 incidents was even caught on Botello’s dashcam as well. She was seen driving away from a shooting in which she could have possibly saved the victim’s life.\n\nAlso, a former SAPD officer was sentenced to 18 months in jail for gruesomely stabbing and shooting his family’s dog.\n\nAlso, it was the SAPD who brutally beat a 16-year-old boy because they smelled marijuana.\n\nYet again, it was 2 SAPD officers who brutally beat a 70-year-old man because they thought he was drunk. He was actually having a diabetic attack.\n\nThese are just the tip of the iceberg. For a full rap sheet on SAPD corruption, you can visit this link, here.\n\nIt’s unclear why the SAPD continues to have such trouble employing quality police officers. Maybe, as TFTP has contended, police departments like SAPD are having so much trouble because the employment qualifications for police officers is so low.\n\nThink about it. If it takes 2 years for a person to become a nurse, and four years for someone to become a teacher, then why do we continue to employ individuals for one of our most crucial public service positions, police officers, after only giving them four months of basic law enforcement training, also known as the “Academy.” It appears that the time spent in the academy needs to be much, much, longer.", "title": "3 Cops in 1 Night, in the Same Town, All Arrested for DUI", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/literal-st-storm-controversy-san-antonio-police-officers-arrested-dui/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

We’ve seen companies use the power of the state to grant themselves monopolies on decades-old drugs, and, in turn, spike the prices to astronomical levels. However, we’ve never heard of an instance of pharmaceutical companies deliberately destroying life-saving products to force the state to raise the price of its drugs — until now.\n\nCancer drugs and their makers are often surrounded by controversy and conspiracy theory. However, they remain in high demand because people rely on them during their battles with cancer. This high demand, over the years, has created a higher supply and by a function of the market — even though it is a state controlled market — resulted in a lower price.\n\nThis natural function of the market apparently infuriated one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies. So, as appears to be the norm in the pharma industry, they took unethical and illegal action to change it.\n\nAccording to a scathing report out of the London Times, who recovered leaked internal emails from Aspen Pharmacare, corruption is the norm and is even celebrated.\n\nAs the Independent reports:\n\nLeaked internal emails appear to show employees at one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies calling for “celebration” over price hikes of cancer drugs, an investigation has revealed. Staff at Aspen Pharmacare reportedly plotted to destroy stocks of life-saving medicines during a price dispute with the Spanish health service in 2014. After purchasing five different cancer drugs from British firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the company tried to sell the medicines in Europe for up to 40 times their previous price, reported The Times.\n\nThe price of Busulfan, a drug used to treat leukemia, rose from £5.20 to £65.22 in England and Wales after this move. Other drugs for fighting cancer quickly skyrocketed as well.\n\nWhat do you do if your unscrupulous business practice of destroying product to manipulate the price of life-saving medicine pays off? Well, you celebrate, of course.\n\nIn a confidential email published by The Times, an Aspen employee appeared to write: “We’ve signed new reimbursement and price agreement successfully: price increases are basically on line with European target prices (Leukeran, a bit higher!)… Let’s celebrate!”\n\nAs the Independent reports:\n\nAccording to The Times’s investigation, the company said it would stop supplying Italy with the drugs in October 2013 if authorities did not agree to price rises of up to 2,100 per cent in three months.\n\nThis all-powerful pharma company was essentially caught holding the government hostage in an unethical ploy to increase their bottom line.\n\nNaturally, they were held accountable and those who facilitated this fraud were brought to task, right? Wrong.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson told the Independent that they are simply proposing more laws to “take action against excessive price rises on unbranded generic medicines.”\n\n“No pharmaceutical company should exploit the NHS,” they said, reported MailOnline.\n\n“We are working closely with the Competition and Markets Authority on unwarranted price rises of unbranded generic medicines, and where companies have breached competition law, we will seek damages and invest that money in the NHS.”\n\nSadly, these measures will likely be in vain.\n\nAs the Free Thought Project reported last year, Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School was the co-author of paradigm-shattering research on drug prices, which led to the Journal of the American Medical Association officially recognizing why drug prices skyrocket in America. Big pharma is granted a monopoly by the state which effectively eliminates their competition and allows them to charge any price they want — so they do.\n\nThe paper, published on August 23, The High Cost of Prescription Drugs in the United States: Origins and Prospects for Reform, set out to “review the origins and effects of high drug prices in the US market and to consider policy options that could contain the cost of prescription drugs.”\n\nThe companies who make these drugs are not beholden to any state, which makes this study applicable to the Aspen case as well.\n\nWhat the paper’s authors, Harvard Medical School doctors Aaron Kesselheim and Jerry Avorn, and jurist Ameet Sarpatwari, found and subsequently admitted, shatters the very assertion that government regulation in the market is needed to keep medical care costs low. In fact, their findings were quite to the contrary.\n\nAccording to the paper:\n\n“The most important factor that allows manufacturers to set high drug prices is market exclusivity, protected by monopoly rights awarded upon Food and Drug Administration approval and by patents.”\n\nImagine that.\n\nIt seems Aspen also knows this as well, and has, like so many companies before them, chosen to game the system.", "title": "Leaked Email Shows Big Pharma Conspired to Destroy Cancer Medicine for 4,000% Profit Increase", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/pharma-destroying-cancer-medicine-profit/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

This list includes M14 and M16 assault rifles, .45-caliber pistols, shotguns, and even vehicles.\n\nSo far, 184 state and local departments have reportedly been suspended in a program that involves the participation of more than 8,000 agencies. Since 1990, the 1033 program has administered more than $4.3 billion worth of equipment and weapons.\n\nIn the wake of heavy police response to protests surrounding the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the topic of police militarization has emerged at the forefront of public debate in the US. Police employed heavily armored vehicles, sniper rifles, tear gas, and riot gear as they confronted demonstrators against excessive force, sparking widespread concern throughout the country, particularly over the Pentagon’s military equipment transfer program.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon stated the program is meant to “enhance public safety and improve homeland security,” critics argue that the inability of police to keep track of their equipment adds another layer of doubt to the idea that security is being improved.\n\n“The case for giving military weaponry to these small police departments was already thin in the beginning,” Tim Lynch of the CATO Institute’s project on criminal justice said to Fusion. “Now that we’re finding that there is insufficient accountability for tracking this equipment, then the case is beginning to fall apart.”\n\nIn at least two cases, Humvees were reported missing. In Georgia, the Humvee was reportedly sold somehow, only to be recovered later and moved to a different department. Another case in Arkansas involved a stolen Humvee that was not reported until a day later.\n\nFirearms were routinely lost or misplaced. In Arizona alone, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department lost 11 or 12 weapons.\n\n“[The program] is obviously very sloppy, and it’s another reason that Congress needs to revisit this promptly,” Lynch added. “We don’t know where these weapons are going, whether they are really lost, or whether there is corruption involved.”\n\nAs RT reported previously, questions over the Pentagon program have reached President Obama as well, as he recently ordered a review of the entire operation. The probe will determine whether or not police should actually be receiving the equipment they get, the way these weapons are being used, and whether officers are being trained properly.\n\nRepublished with permission from Russia Today", "title": "Dozens of Police Departments Suspended for 'Losing' US Military-grade Weaponry", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/dozens-police-departments-suspended-losing-military-grade-weaponry/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

While US President Donald Trump is threatening to “take care” of the North Korean “problem,” Pyongyang says it is ready to repel any military action.\n\n“Lately, tensions have risen with the US and the ROK [South Korea] on one side, and the DPRK [North Korea] on the other,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters on Friday, adding that “One has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment.”\n\nHe cautioned both sides that “if a war occurs, the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner,” and that whichever side provoked a conflict “must assume the historic responsibility and pay the corresponding price.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Wang said both Washington and Pyongyang must refrain from “provoking and threatening each other, whether in words or actions, and not let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage,” as cited by Reuters.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to cool down the US administration’s bellicose rhetoric, he added: “Force cannot solve the problem – dialogue can be the only channel to resolving the problem.”\n\nChina, North Korea’s close ally and main trading partner, does not welcome Pyongyang’s nuclear program, but advocates finding political solution to the crisis. For its part, Russia, which also shares a land border with the reclusive state, expressed deep concern over the mounting tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe tension on the Korean Peninsula was one of the topics Wang Yi discussed with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in a Friday phone call.\n\nMoscow stands for “politico-diplomatic reconciliation” and urges all parties to show patience and refrain from “any actions which might mean making provocative steps,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1953, the US fought against North Korea’s troops in the Korean War. After the US-led coalition forces crossed the 38th parallel dividing the two Koreas, China deployed troops and entered the war, while the USSR rendered military and logistical support to their socialist allies. The conflict, which quickly became a war of attrition, claimed the lives of over 33,000 American and 400,000 North Korean soldiers.\n\nAccording to some media reports, the ongoing US military buildup close to North Korean waters may go far beyond an ordinary show of force. On Thursday, American intelligence officials told NBC that the US has sent two destroyers capable of launching Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, with one just 300 miles (some 480 km) from the North Korean nuclear test site.\n\nAmerican long-range bombers have also been positioned in Guam to hit North Korean targets. In turn, North Korea warned on Tuesday it would retaliate to any sign of American aggression with all means available.\n\n“If the US dares opt for a military action, crying out for ‘pre-emptive attack’, [Pyongyang] is ready to react. We will hold the US wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions,” North Korea’s deputy foreign minister said in an interview with AP.\n\n“The US introduces into the Korean Peninsula, the world’s biggest hotspot, huge nuclear strategic assets, seriously threatening peace and security of the peninsula and pushing the situation there to the brink of a war,” the North’s General Staff said in a statement carried by KCNA.", "title": "China Issues Dire Warning — New Korean War Could Break Out 'At Any Moment'", "url": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/china-issues-warning-new-korean-war/", "main": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com", "fact": "MIXED"}

Wrote Goldberg, “Traditionally, during the transition period, presidents-elect are out of the limelight. But while Barack Obama was still in the White House, Donald Trump announced ‘deals’ and appointments that made it seem like he was already in office, hitting the ground running to Make America Great Again. On the entirely subjective calculus of wins, he probably had more before his inauguration than any president. Conversely, the first 100 days are supposed to be a time of big domestic legislative achievements. Instead, they’ve looked more like the lame-duck period of a president’s second term. Once sworn in, rather than get a political honeymoon with the news media, Trump had an angry divorce. And instead of giving Trump a big gift-wrapped box of legislation, Congress has mostly given him the sorts of headaches presidents have to deal with when they’ve lost their clout.”\n\nGoldberg added, “The question is, what happens when the list of easy Ws runs out? There’s little evidence that Trump is operating with a coherent strategic vision, which means that he won’t have a thought-out criteria for knowing when to say no to the generals he clearly admires. For a true lame duck president, that may not matter — when the Ws run out, he’s out of office.

They are blocked by a decision of the Swiss government to, in an effort of self-preservation, close its border with Italy.\n\nAs the ragtag groups of immigrants wait for human smugglers to somehow get them to points north, they have set up tents and strewn trash on the land next door to Clooney’s resort mansion.\n\nClooney has spoken at length about the need for western nations to take in all the immigrants and refugees that they possibly can. Question for Mr. Clooney: why only western nations? Why not lands inhabited by folks who mostly share the same faith and have much more similar cultures?\n\nClooney has not been shy about slamming Donald Trump for limiting immigration to the United States, with criticisms about the building of a southern border wall, deportation of illegal immigrants, and a temporary ban on certain countries that are havens for Muslim jihadis.\n\nGeorge has described these common-sense national sovereignty policies of the President as “massively stupid,” while describing Trump as “a xenophobic fascist.”\n\nClooney has attempted to shame Americans who prefer limits on immigration as “forgetting who we are.” He has said, “You forget that these are people who didn’t just leave their country for no reason at all. These are people who left because [of] a terrible tragedy.”\n\nMr. Clooney would do well to educate himself and take a stroll to the end of his property and have a good look at those have swollen the numbers at the Lake Como immigrant encampment. He may notice a very disproportionate number of “refugees” who are able-bodied young men of fighting age, not exactly what one would expect if these people were all, in fact, refugees.\n\nThe truth is, most of the people fleeing their homelands and heading for Europe have not experienced tragedies, but are instead looking for the nanny states of Europe to take care of them. They are not choosing to stay home and improve their own countries. And when they reach their desired destinations, most will not assimilate into the cultures that welcome them.\n\nThe thoughts of some of George’s neighbors on the immigrant influx to Lake Como are informative. Federica, 55-year-old housewife, said: ‘A small number of immigrants is not a problem but now they are so many. You see them arriving at that the [sic] San Giovanni station. They are not poor hungry refugees but they are big and strong. People here in Como don’t like them. There are simply too many of them.’ Santi, 26-year-old chauffeur, said: ‘It is good for Switzerland that they have closed the border to migrants but it is bad for Italy. We simply don’t have the resources to deal with all these new people. Italy has lots of problems of our own without having to try to deal with other people’s problems. It is a complex situation.’ Maria, a local restaurant owner, said: ‘I don’t want them here. Italy has enough problems without trying to solve the problems of the world. We [Italy] should not have to deal with these people on our own. Europe [the EU] does nothing to help us. Now they make us – me, my family and other Italian families – pay for them.’ In 2016 George and Amal Clooney met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and thanked her throwing open the gates of Europe to the immigrant masses. What the reality of millions of immigrants swarming into Europe means to the rank-and-file citizen of those nations likely never crossed George’s mind, insulated from it all in his Lake Como hideaway. But now, perhaps, the reality will sink in for this celebrity utopian, as that reality has made its way to his very doorstep.

Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson (both Democrats.)\n\nWhile President Trump certainly sympathizes with the New Deal coalition of working class Americans, senior citizens, and the disabled, he also knows that the Democrats have turned these relief measures into bottomless feeding troughs.\n\nLegal and illegal immigrant households consume the largest share of welfare in the U.S., thus costing U.S. taxpayers thousands of dollars every year.\n\nExpansive welfare and welfare dependency can also be directly linked to increase crime rates.\n\nMany of these welfare recipients are lifelong Democrats.

Fortunately, the security team took their job seriously, and for the safety of other passengers, they would not let her pass.\n\nAs the Sun reports, the female security official explained, “You are not safe,” adding, “You could hide something in your hair. If you don’t take it off, we do not know if there’s something inside, okay? You are not safe for us.”\n\nIn the end, Adzkia finally admitted defeat:\n\n“Later in the evening, I booked a ticket to London flying from Fiumicino airport. During the security check the security officials also insisted I take off my hijab. This time I agreed because I wanted to prove to them that I have nothing to hide and that I am not a terrorist.”\n\nMuslims like Aghnia Adzkia love to complain and cause a stir, but the truth is, these security officials are doing outstanding work. Who knows what kind of weapon or explosive could be hidden underneath the hijab? Besides, airports offer private rooms for hijab inspections. People like Adzkia are denying reality if they believe that hijab inspections are discriminatory. H/T Conservativeworlddaily Throwing fits and posting them to social media does not help their cause in the least. It’s about time that Muslims around the world learn that the West won’t cave to their demands or tolerate their expectations of special treatment any longer, just like Adzkia finally seemed to realize, albeit the hard way.\n\nFollow Donald Trump News on Instagram!", "title": "Entitled Muslim Refuses to Remove Hijab at Airport – Gets a HARSH Slap of Reality!", "url": "http://donaldtrumpnews.co/news/entitled-muslim-refuses-remove-hijab-airport-gets-harsh-slap-reality/", "main": "http://donaldtrumpnews.co", "fact": ""}

{"category": "Questionable Sources", "date": "2017-04-19 00:36:15+00:00", "authors": [], "content": "By Dr Leon Tressell\n\nLast week the American military fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Syrian Shayat airforce base.\n\nPresident Trump ordered this in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack on the rebel held town of Khan Sheikhun. Without producing any evidence the Trump administration and its NATO allies are putting the blame for this chemical weapons attack squarely on the shoulders of the Assad government.\n\nThis is not the first time that the United States has directly attacked a military facility of the Assad government. Readers may recall the American air force attack that killed over 60 Syrian Arab Army soldiers at Deir Ezzor last September. On that occasion the US military claimed that this accidental error which just happened to coincide with an Isis attack upon Deir Ezzor airport.\n\nThe cruise missile attack represents something of a Rubicon moment where the American military enters a qualitatively new stage in its military intervention into the Syrian civil war. Since the attack the Trump administration has been aggressively asserting its right to carry out further strikes upon the Syrian Arab Army.\n\nTwo days ago, Trump held a joint press conference with Jens Stoltenberg NATO secretary general at the White House. The president affirmed his commitment to the American led military alliance claiming that NATO was ‘no longer obsolete’. Trump went yet further and stated that NATO had a role to play in fighting IS in Iraq while approving Montenegro’s membership of NATO in the teeth of Moscow’s objections. Meanwhile, Stoltenberg emphasised NATO’s role in deterring a ‘more assertive Russia’ by sending four new battle groups to Poland and the Baltics countries.\n\nThis all chimes with the American troop surge in Iraq and the growing number of American special forces fighting alongside the Kurdish led SDF in eastern Syria. It is quite clear that the movement of SDF forces towards the caliphate’s capital of Raqqa is all about the grabbing of territory before the expulsion of Isis forces from eastern Syria.\n\nAny study of the rapidly changing battlefront in Syria shows that the Syrian Arab Army is moving as rapidly as it can into eastern Syria. This in competition with the SDF forces that have crossed onto the western bank of the Euphrates River in an attempt to cut off the caliphate’s capital from central Syria.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the leadership of the Kurdish led Canton’s of Rojava are prepared to give up any territory that they have taken from Isis forces in Northern Syria. No doubt this reflects the huge influx of military resources pouring into the SDF from the Pentagon and their perceived weakness of the Assad regime.\n\nThis together with Turkey’s declaration that it will not withdraw its military forces from the areas it has taken from Isis in northern Syria poses a real dilemma for the Moscow-Teheran-Damascus axis.\n\nThis axis is confronting the Sunni terrorist threat, both in Idlib province against Tahrir al-Sham (Al Qaeda), and in eastern Syria against Isis.\n\nDespite the bellicose words coming out of some sections of the Russian government it has not responded to the cruise missile strike in any meaningful way. Moscow has continued the so-called hotline with the American air force to avoid any unintentional clashes over the Syrian airspace.\n\nThe defeat of Isis in Syria and Iraq over the next period will not bring peace to these war-torn countries. In both countries there is the near insoluble issue of Kurdish autonomy within each country. Both Damascus and Baghdad have stated that they have no intention of giving the Kurds any kind of meaningful autonomy within Syria and Iraq.\n\nThis situation is complicated yet further by the neo-Ottoman ambitions of Erdogan’s Turkey. Erdogan is playing the nationalist card at home and using the Kurdish insurgency in south-eastern Turkey as an excuse to grab territory in both northern Syria and northern Iraq.\n\nOver the next period the so called peace talks in Astana will lumber on without reaching any meaningful conclusion. It is quite clear that Washington together with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and NATO have no desire to see a political settlement to the war in Syria. There is no way that Washington would allow the Assad regime to triumph in the Syrian conflict as it would be a major blow to its geopolitical ambitions in the Middle East. Rather, they seek the partition of Syria as a means of blocking the expanding influence of Moscow and Tehran in the region.\n\nThe muted response of Putin to the American cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base will no doubt give confidence to the neocons in the Trump administration. As Trump struggles to deal with the horrendous social and economic problems facing the United States, he may well decide to double down on the American gambit in Syria and authorise further missile strikes upon the Syrian Arab Army.\n\nWe should not be too surprised by further cruise missile strikes by the American military upon the infrastructure of Assad’s armed forces. This of course contains within it the seeds for a further escalation of the Syrian conflict and the danger of an open military confrontation between the United States and Russia.", "title": "Trump administration crosses a Red Line in Syria", "url": "http://www.hangthebankers.com/rubicon-trump-administration-crosses-red-line-syria/", "main": "http://www.hangthebankers.com", "fact": ""}

At one point in 2015, Samsung’s privacy policy warned people not to talk about private conversations in front of their TVs.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks’ Vault 7 release, “Year Zero” exposes the CIA’s covert hacking program, including exploits against products like iPhone, Android, Windows, and Samsung TVs. The CIA has an extensive hacking division, WikiLeaks said, which is composed over over 5,000 registered users and more than a thousand hacking systems and malware. Samsung TVs are particularly vulnerable and “turned into covert microphones.”\n\nWikiLeaks wrote:\n\nThe attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a ‘Fake-Off’ mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In ‘Fake-Off’ mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.\n\nYou can read all the files about Weeping Angel here.\n\nInterestingly, this really shouldn’t come as a shock to the public. The CIA has been very open about its interest in hacking appliances. In fact, before Smart TVs became popular, it was known that the CIA wanted to spy on people through their appliances, according to this article by Network World. Then-CIA Director David Petraeus spoke at a CIA’s venture capital firm in 2012 and said the CIA was interested in monitoring items in the home that were connected to the Internet.\n\nIn fact, in 2015 Samsung’s SmartTV privacy policy warned people not to discuss private information in front of their TV.\n\nLeft: Samsung SmartTV privacy policy, warning users not to discuss personal info in front of their TV\n\nRight: 1984 pic.twitter.com/osywjYKV3W — Parker Higgins (@xor) February 8, 2015\n\nThe warning read:\n\nPlease be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\n\nAfter criticism of the “Orwellian” TV privacy policy, Samsung edited out that policy, TechCrunch reported at the time. Samsung posted a rebuttal at the time and said that its SmartTVs “do not monitor living room conversations.” However, it appears that thanks to the CIA hack, according to WikiLeaks, they might have. But Samsung may not have been aware of this.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks’ file about the Samsung hack, the Samsung F8000 Smart TV was the one at risk. The file states that updating firmware over the Internet might remove the implant and that “Firmware version 1118+ eliminated current USB installation method.” Note: This doesn’t mean other types of Smart TVs weren’t hackable, this is just what is specifically noted in the file.\n\nSOURCE", "title": "CIA and MI5 hacked Samsung Smart TV's to spy on people, even when switched off", "url": "http://www.hangthebankers.com/cia-mi5-hacked-samsung-smart-tvs-spy/", "main": "http://www.hangthebankers.com", "fact": ""}

Nothing worked.\n\nBut then, like many other foreigners, he journeyed to Peru’s remote Amazonian jungle to drink ayahuasca, a centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew that some Western scientists think can help to heal psychological traumas.\n\nDuring a recent ayahuasca ritual, the 30-rr-old from Oklahoma lay on a mattress with about 20 other travelers on the floor of a round, wooden hut in a remote resort near a tributary of the Amazon River. About 45 minutes after drinking the dark concoction, he began to see vibrant colors. He then vomited into a plastic bucket, a common reaction to ayahuasca.\n\nMr. Barrett acknowledged that it didn’t appear therapeutic. But he also described seeing visions of war-torn Afghanistan emerging as a shaman chanted spiritual songs called icaros. He recalled seeing bullet holes in a wall, a dead Afghan woman and the moment when an improvised explosive device almost killed him. He saw his small military base in Afghanistan’s mountainous border region with Pakistan. He heard a loud voice.\n\nAnd then came a burst of light.\n\n“It was as if I was just letting it all go,” Mr. Barrett said later. “I just felt so at ease for the first time in a long time.”\n\nU.S. military veteran Asa Barrett at an ayahuasca center in the Peruvian jungle in January. Some Western scientists think the centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew can help heal psychological traumas.\n\nIn the Amazon, scientists have long studied plants with a range of medicinal properties. Some work as anesthetics; others can treat infections; some are known to stop bleeding. Now scientists are starting to look at ayahuasca, a potent hallucinogen known locally as “the vine of the soul” that outsiders are increasingly flocking to sample.\n\nScientists say that ayahuasca—which is legal in Peru and neighboring countries—activates parts of the brain that make it possible to recall deep-rooted memories, increasing self-awareness and offering a chance to reassess past ordeals. Proponents say that it can provide users with spiritual and personal guidance. Others report that it has allowed them to overcome traumas that conventional therapy and antidepressants haven’t cured.\n\nBut some scientists—and users—warn that ayahuasca can be dangerous. It can be fatal when mixed with other drugs, such as antidepressants, and should be avoided by those who are bipolar or schizophrenic, since it has been known to trigger psychotic episodes. In 2012, a young man from California died after taking ayahuasca in Peru. And last year a Canadian tourist killed a Briton during a nighttime ritual that local authorities are still investigating.\n\nThe brew is made by boiling together a jungle vine called Banisteriopsis caapi with the leaves of a shrub that contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a psychedelic that is illegal in the U.S. DMT can cause seizures and, in high doses, comas and respiratory arrests, said Mike Colston, a U.S. Navy captain who heads a Department of Defense agency in charge of studying psychological health and brain injury. The hallucinations caused by ayahuasca can be so traumatic that they can worsen medical conditions such as PTSD, Dr. Colston cautioned.\n\nIn Peru, the influx of foreigners eager to try the brew has spurred the creation of unregulated new lodges to try ayahuasca, some of which, locals say, are opportunistic and employ fake shamans with little training. The brew itself is unregulated by the Peruvian government.\n\nAyahuasca’s proponents say that it has powerful properties. Jeffrey Hill, a 38-year-old construction superintendent from Chicago, said that ayahuasca eased his depression. Juliet Wilkerson, 41, who lives in Texas, said that it helped to cure her debilitating migraines, which she thinks were tied to childhood abuse. Jaylene Johnston, a 53-year-old from Oklahoma, said she had visions of her deceased first husband that allowed her to overcome the trauma of his death and fully commit to her current spouse. “It transformed the relationships that I have right now,” she said.\n\nThe stories might seem surreal. But they have prompted growing interest by Western researchers, amid a wider revival of studies into the therapeutic use of psychedelics.\n\nThe California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which has funded researchers at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, plans to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an ayahuasca study in the U.S.\n\nThe California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies aims to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the FDA for a study in the U.S.\n\nJessica Nielson, a University of California, San Francisco, neuroscientist who is leading the study, became interested in the potion after trying it herself following a difficult divorce and doubts about her career trajectory. In Peru, she saw how it helped three military veterans.\n\n“Just witnessing their transformation inspired me,” she said. But she cautioned that ayahuasca research is in its infancy. “We really need to get more data on this to understand the safety, what are the limits and who is it appropriate for,” she said.\n\nOther scientists are hoping to understand the brew’s properties. Charles Grob, a psychiatrist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center who studied ayahuasca’s use in a Brazilian church, says that it might help to treat addiction. Jordi Riba, a pharmacologist at the Sant Pau Institute of Biomedical Research in Barcelona, says that ayahuasca may help ease depression.\n\nBecause the experience can be frightening, both men emphasized the importance of consuming the brew in a safe setting A.J. Bullock, a 30-year-old Army sergeant who served in Afghanistan, described nightmarish hallucinations of being chained down and confronted by demons after trying ayahuasca in Peru. It made him feel paranoid, he said, and he considered going home early. By his last ritual, he described a helpful, “radical shift in self-image.” Still, he hesitates to recommend the experience.\n\n“I just don’t know if a lot of people would be able to walk away from it not having gone crazy or at least hurting them more than it helped them,” he said.\n\nDespite the risks, foreigners are converging on Iquitos, a city of 500,000 in Peru’s northeastern Amazon, paying up to $2,500 a week to drink the elixir. Carmen Rojas, the head of the local tourism office, says that she knows of 22 certified jungle lodges that offer ayahuasca. But local tour operators speak of dozens more, including almost 100 ayahuasca centers along one 60-mile stretch of highway. They estimate that as many as 80,000 people a year come to Iquitos for ayahuasca.\n\nOne operator, Pulse Tours, says that its clients are mainly Americans and Canadians but also include people from as far away as Australia, China, Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\nSome longtime ayahuasca proponents in Iquitos lament the recent influx of tourism dollars, which they feel has corrupted the ritual and put some foreigners at risk from fly-by-night operators in the burgeoning industry.\n\n“People have got way too careless about all of this,” said Howard Lawler, 68, a Kentucky native who runs Spirit Quest Shamanic Sanctuary, one of the longest-running ayahuasca centers here. “It is never to be taken for any recreational purpose.

But we’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,” he said.\n\nThe White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve.\n\nA sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process.\n\nIn February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests.\n\nThat report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road.\n\nCongressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform.\n\nOn Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month’s end of sweeping legislation known as the “Financial CHOICE Act” that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul.\n\nThe new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s supervisory powers and make the director removable at will.\n\nIt would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash.\n\nThe bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation.\n\nParticipants in Tuesday’s meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co.\n\nThe business leaders are part of Trump’s “Strategy and Policy Forum” that last met with him in February.\n\nTrump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\n“NAFTA is a disaster. It’s been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we’re going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you,” he said.\n\nSOURCE", "title": "Wall Street reform rules may be eliminated", "url": "http://www.hangthebankers.com/trumps-bankers-wall-street-reform-rules-eliminated/", "main": "http://www.hangthebankers.com", "fact": ""}

The results are ringing alarm bells among some liberals.\n\nA USA Today/Suffolk University poll, conducted in the first week of March, shows Trump’s approval rating at 47 percent, and his personal favorability at 45 percent. Sixty percent of respondents disapprove of his temper, and 59 percent think he tweets too much.\n\nWhile USA Today called Trump’s approval “a poor rating by historic standards,” the numbers looked even worse for his opponent in the November 2016 presidential election and the opposition Democratic Party: Hillary Clinton recorded only a 35 percent approval rating, while the Democrats were at 36 percent.\n\nLatest Suffolk poll should be a wake up call to Democrats pic.twitter.com/OyJ1VvhRH8 — James C Mazareas (@Jamie_Maz) March 8, 2017\n\n“This is a disaster. At a time when Donald Trump is the least liked president ever measured at this point in his first term, the Democratic Party has found a way to be even less liked than him. This is how Donald Trump wins a second term,”progressive activist Shaun King wrote in the New York Daily News on Thursday.\n\nThe Democratic party “struggles to hear the truth about itself,” King added, and pointed out that most Democrats he spoke with could not tell him what the party stands for.\n\nLast month, the Democrats elected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as their new National Committee chair. Perez was backed by Clinton and former President Barack Obama, while his principal rival, Rep. Keith Ellison (R-Minnesota) enjoyed the support of the left wing of the party, led by independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe party’s poor showing in the Suffolk poll is even more significant when considering that the sample of 1,000 registered voters included 352 Democrats, 330 Republicans and 318 independents.\n\nBroken down by party affiliation, Trump’s approval rating is much higher among Republicans (88 percent) and is higher than disapproval among independents by 2 percentage points.

{"category": "Questionable Sources", "date": "2017-04-20 00:54:14+00:00", "authors": [], "content": "It was almost exactly two years ago when a cash-strapped Venezuela quietly conducted its first, little-noticed gold-for-cash swap with Citigroup, as part of which Nicolas Maduro converted part of his nation’s gold reserves into at least $1 billion in cash courtesy of the US bank.\n\nAs Reuters reported then, the motive was simple: convert $1 billion of the country’s gold into much needed dollars to fund imports and keep the economy from sinking.\n\nHowever, instead of selling the gold outright, a move which would have been met with a firestorm of protests from political opponents and allies alike, Maduro merely leased it to Citi instead.\n\nSpecifically, Venezuela provided 1.4 million troy ounces of gold to Citi in exchange for cash. And while Venezuela would have to pay interest on the funds, it got the key benefit of being able to maintain the gold as part of its foreign currency reserves. After all, the gold was “merely rehypothecated”, if only on paper, the actual physical gold would be transferred to an unknown vault of Citi’s choosing where it would become an asset effectively controlled by the bailed out US ban (there was a brief scare last July when Citi warned it would close the account of the Venezuela Central Bank, which prompted us to ask if Citigroup was about to confiscate $1 billion in Venezuela gold).\n\nWhile it is still unknown if Citi did in fact confiscate a substantial chunk of Venezuela’s sovereign gold, what is worth noting is that even just two years ago, Venezuela was in far better economic and social shape than it is currently, which ultimately prompted Maduro’s choice of picking a swap instead of an outright sale of the country’s gold. Now, however, with hyperinflation rampant, with daily protests, many of which turn violent and deadly, and with the opposition set to unleash the “mother of all protests” on Wednesday even as Maduro has ordered the army to take to the streets, the president has far fewer qualms about preserving even the illusion of stability at this point.\n\nWhat he does need, however, is access to dollars, be it to pay Venezuela’s creditors, provide funds to the cash strapped state-owned energy company PDVSA, or simply to pay the army which is the only thing keeping the nation away from a revolution, and Maduro from facing a deadly endgame.\n\nWhich is why Maduro is about to do what he did two years ago, only on a vastly greater scale, and perhaps simply sell Venezuela’s gold outright.\n\nThat is the allegation made by Venezuela’s opposition, which according to Bloomberg has reached out to Wall Street banks to dissuade them from helping Maduro sell Venezuela’s $7.7 billion in gold reserves (as of February) With Venezuela’s foreign reserve hoard rapidly declining, gold now represents one of its most valuable assets; total foreign reserves stood at $10.3 billion on Monday, near a 15-year low.\n\nThe letter sent by the opposition-led congress on Monday to top US banks, warns that Venezuela is going to try to stave off default by seeking to swap its gold reserves into cash, and any investment bank that helps will be effectively “supporting a government recognized by the international community as dictatorial.” Furthermore, lawmakers also approved a measure today that they say would nullify any government debt issuance, as well as any debt swaps and pledges of gold as collateral, not explicitly approved by congress.\n\n“The national government, through the central bank, is going to try to swap gold held as reserves for dollars to stay in power unconstitutionally,” according to the letter signed by National Assembly President Julio Borges. “I have the obligation to warn you that by supporting such a gold swap you would be taking actions favoring a government that’s been recognized as dictatorial by the international community.”\n\nLawmaker Angel Alvarado, a member of the National Assembly’s Finance Committee, said the letter has gone to banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, as Maduro rides a wave of anger over triple-digit inflation and chronic shortages of basic staples, investors are trying to determine the odds that the country will continue servicing its debt amid a dollar shortage worsened by the collapse in oil prices.\n\nAnd speaking of Maduro, on Tuesday evening, speaking on state television the president said he would make declaration later Tuesday. “I will reveal tonight the right wing’s complete plans for the coming days and I will make a special declaration so the republic is alert,” Maduro said, adding that supporters should be alert to “defeat the coup d’etat and intervention.” And then, moments ago, Maduro accused opposition leader Borges of calling for a coup.\n\nAs a reminder, we reported yesterday that Maduro has ordered the army into the streets as the insolvent nation braces for what the opposition has vowed will be the “mother of all protests” on Wednesday.\n\nWhatever the outcome of tomorrow’s protest, or Maduro’s upcoming gold lease or sale, one thing is certain: Hugo Chavez, who spent the last years of his life repatriating Venezuela’s gold is spinning in his grave.\n\nSOURCE", "title": "Maduro planning to swap Venezuela's gold for dollars", "url": "http://www.hangthebankers.com/maduro-swap-venezuela-gold-dollars/", "main": "http://www.hangthebankers.com", "fact": ""}

Now, thanks to President Donald Trump, they’re finally being honored with their own day.\n\nAccording to KCEN-TV, Trump has signed a bill designating March 29 as an annual National Vietnam War Veterans Day.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana.\n\nThe Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017 got through the Senate last month and the House last week.\n\nToomey highlighted the poor treatment given to Vietnam veterans returning home as part of the reason he supported the act.\n\n“Some of them were actually treated quite poorly,” Toomey said.\n\n“And that was a tragic period in our history driven by people’s perceptions of the war. Fortunately, that, I think, is behind us now.

However, the act signed by Trump makes the celebration an annual event.\n\nTrump also tweeted his recognition of the day:\n\nToday we honored our true American heroes on the first-ever National Vietnam War Veterans Day.#ThankAVeteran https://t.co/hnS8jD9Rfr pic.twitter.com/BY44VFuY7K — Donald J.

It’s a tragedy beyond words that we, as a country, have been so remiss in remembering their sacrifice and their valor. We can only hope that in coming years, these brave individuals are given the recognition they are owed by the country they so valiantly served.

Being able to recognise how possible a situation is, and making proper use of the available data to enhance performance is well dependent on proficiency. Being unable to recognise the likelihoods of pertinent propositions, and making rash moves in the occurrence of premature cynicism or unjustified certainty is implied to as Incompetence.\n\nThis isn’t supporting the notion that there aren’t cases where adept players flop and amateurs win – especially common on video slot machines. We are only saying that this knowledge assists players to surpass or meet their targets at times when fortune smirks their way or incur a minimal loss when it frowns. This is applicable in moments when a player is faced with options to make a decision. We find it related also to sensitive cases such as keeping calm at periods that seems severe but actually are the usual cold and hot moments, matching bankroll to the size of bet, leaving the game at loss or profit stages dependable on the instability and edge of a game.\n\nSeveral Groups Of Gamblers And The Intuitional Misconceptions\n\n\n\nIt is unfortunate that some players mistake what intuition really is. This is why we find a little group of gamblers that go ahead to study the game that they plan to bet on and try to learn what the geniuses predict would give the best chances to succeed.\n\nWhereas, we have some other group that just go ahead to play the game since they have the believe that all is dependent on luck – why bother then?\n\nThere is another group, which seems to be the largest, and they depend on the intuition that they developed from experience.\n\nWe can say a lot about intuition, but it is important to keep cautions as well. The possible pitfalls are illustrated by casino games in which it is required to settle bets based on the poker values of hands, and those with a “stud” – no draw – format while playing.\n\nSome Instances That Intuition Doesn’t Really Apply\n\n\n\nSome of such games including Let It Ride and Caribbean Stud that are played with five-card hands are already featured in many casinos. You must have seen the three-card poker in the casinos near you, and if not, it should appear there soon. One thing that is similar to these games is that they disobey intuition. This is because their three- and five-hand formats are different mathematically compared to the seven-card stud and the previous five-card draw models. In other words, their distinct statistical characteristics are seen not to favour those gamblers that are used to the conventional examples of poker.\n\nWhat this means, in essence, is that intuition does lead to good decision making, but we should remember this is not on a 100 percent. One should work on conscious control and practice because the system runs by recognising patterns, which might require some of your time. Just as a majority of players enjoy a free slot on line play from 777extraslot.com, it is simple; you develop a familiarity to the complexities of a game due to the more time you spend at it.", "title": "Good Intuition in Gambling Is Just a Well-Calculated Strategy", "url": "http://newsexaminer.net/gaming/good-intuition-gambling-just-well-calculated-strategy/", "main": "http://newsexaminer.net", "fact": ""}

Whether you’re a start-up business or you’ve been operating a little while now, one thing which can really help that you may want to look into, is trade finance.\n\nWhat is trade finance?\n\nTrade finance is designed to help tide you over while you’re waiting for invoices to be paid.\n\nYou’ll likely have already discovered the common problem all small businesses in the trade sector face: An order comes through, so you need to get the goods from your supplier. However, the supplier requires immediate payment, but you need to wait potentially 30 days before your customers pay you. This can leave a significant cash flow issue. That’s where trade finance steps in.\n\nIt’s basically similar to a payday loan, where you receive a sum of money and you pay it back in full, plus a little interest on an agreed day. With trade finance however, you use your trade deal as proof of income and you can be paid part or all of the invoice in advance; allowing you to pay your suppliers without worrying about being short of funds.\n\nSo, you’re being paid what you should be anyway, only it gives you access to the funds much quicker.\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nSo, why is trade finance worth looking into? Well, it provides convenience, flexibility, continuous cash flow, and security.\n\nAs soon as you’ve set up a line of credit with a trade finance company such as Touch Financial, you’ll easily be able to take advantage of it as and when you need it.\n\nHowever, it’s the fact it allows you to keep a continuous cash flow that’s the real benefit. This is one of the biggest struggles which come from starting up a trade business. Many companies have been forced to close their doors because they couldn’t afford to bridge that initial payment gap.\n\nOverall, trade finance is becoming much more popular these days. In a time where it’s difficult to get the finance you need through traditional methods such as via the bank, these trade finance deals are an excellent alternative. Provided you use a reliable company, you should find the interest rates to be very reasonable too.", "title": "The Benefits of Trade Finance When Running a Small Business", "url": "http://newsexaminer.net/finance/benefits-trade-finance-running-small-business/", "main": "http://newsexaminer.net", "fact": ""}

Always beginning with free-form ideas, he visualizes elements (influenced by everything from conceptual art, skate culture, illustration, and family history) and puts them to canvas in a gesture reminiscent of surrealist automatic drawings. For his‘sectional’ pieces, he creates large painted studies that are then graphed out in alphanumeric order and ‘cut’ top to bottom, left to right on a grid. He works to ensure they do not resemble the original piece, that he opens himself to randomness, chance, the subconscious, where new layers of meaning emerge. Transforming one panel at a time, individual sections become both contained compositions and elements of a larger one. Once complete, he titles the piece based on thematic threads, or patterns, that have revealed themselves in the process. This interplay between structure and flow state, of finding resolution in shape, form, and thought, are a hallmark of Horner’s practice and body of work.\n\nIn the monumental Vessel in Passing # 3, Horner populates a dense landscape with figures, natural elements morphing into animal forms, and urban scenes over thirty-two sectionals. Presented at mural-scale, the piece is a culmination of Horner’s ‘street surrealism’; a dream-like blending of personal imagery and unresolved stories.\n\nBIO\n\nJJ HORNER was born in 1982 in Wilmar, MN, home of Jenny O Turkey. At thirteen, he started skateboarding, where he found a tight-knit culture of art and music that changed his trajectory forever. He moved to Arizona in 1998, eventually earning an Associate’s degree from the Art Institute of Phoenix in multimedia web design. After a severe skateboarding injury, he turned his attention full-time to art-making, with a focus on painting. In 2012, he formed Pyramid Country with Bobby Green and Jackson Casey, a skateboarding-centric production and apparel company.\n\n@jojamhorner @pyramidcountry", "title": "\"PATTERN RECOGNITION\" new works by JJ Horner", "url": "http://newsexaminer.net/art/pattern-recognition-new-works-jj-horner/", "main": "http://newsexaminer.net", "fact": ""}

He then deleted my pen name, Darius Rubics, as the author of my own stories and replaced them with “National Reporting Staff”. After complaining, he deleted ALL of my articles that I worked so hard on since I began working with National Report in early 2013. Seeing this, most of the authors were angry, as I was of course and contacted me offering condolences. After this he also fired some of his best writers because they were associating with me. That is actually where I got my video guy, Eric Foster, after Allen fired him. I told Allen I would never approach any of his writers with job offers, and I never did. Luckily I have all my work posted on Super Official News, so it is not lost, but it still hurts. Allen even deleted my Banksy story that had over 5 million Facebook shares and climbing 🙁\n\nFrom Paul Horner’s Facebook page:\n\n“Wikipedia says I’m an “internet news satirist and article writer for numerous online satirical news sites”. I love art, drawing and other creative things. I love my family and friends. I occasionally do stand-up comedy.”\n\nPaul Horner On Television\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin\n\n\n\nFAPPY FUN FACT: Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin has over 47,000 likes/followers on Facebook and has been arrested four times for public masturbation and has been pardoned by the governor.\n\nIt’s all just a fun hobby, Michael Moore is making a movie about it (link)(link), and a great way to sell merch!\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and STOP Masturbation NOW focus on educating children about the dangerous consequences of masturbation and the benefits of genetically modified foods ~ Paid for by the Monsanto Company\n\nPhoenix, Arizona 12/27/14 – Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin (Paul Horner) doing standup comedy in downtown Phoenix, Arizona\n\nA big thank you to the funny and talented Erick Biez for hosting and playing along perfectly considering this was the first attempt at this. You seriously can’t see anything out of this mask and you have to yell for people to hear you. Working on fixing that. Also, thank you so much Matt Storrs for filming! The video cuts off at the very end because the phone ran out of memory, but you’ll get the idea.\n\nTo get more people to my set I wrote a story about Bill Murray being there, and it packed the house:\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/standup-comedy/bill-murray-performs-heimlich-maneuver-saves-choking-man/\n\nPraise Fappy!\n\nPaul Horner has a drink named after him because of his Banksy story and hoax. It’s their most popular drink.\n\nOne of the most popular drinks on Silver’s winter drink menu is the Paul Horner. The ingredient that makes this cocktail specifically unique is red bell pepper. Intrigued? Us too.\n\n\n\nBecause of my Banksy hoax story I wrote a couple months ago about him getting arrested and outed as Paul Horner, a fancy restaurant (like $200 steaks) that actually owns two original Banksy’s… named a drink called ‘The Paul Horner’. It’s their most popular drink – like a $50+ drink. And this place, it’s called ‘Silver’, is where the Winter Olympics were held, the Sundance film festival is etc. Millionaires bring in their own tequila to make my drink how they like it.\n\nThink about this…. ALL drinks start from somewhere. For example, that drink “Tom Collins”, that started from a real guy named “Tom Collins”, and now because of the popularity of my drink, a few other places are starting to serve it.\n\nLook at the ingredients, so many and so elaborate. This is not a rum and coke ha. Makes me so happy and I want to drink it now! I was featured in Vice News, Banksy knows of me and my name, and now I have my own drink. I can die now.This is a review for my drink:\n\nhttp://dishingpc.com/silvers-paul-horner/ This is the restaurant that started serving ‘The Paul Horner’.\n\nwww.silverrestaurant.com/. I spoke with them. They said it tastes like a bloody marry and a margarita kind of. They are sending me out a care package with bottles of tequila and all the 15 or so ingredients to make this thing. And this is out of UTAH! I love the idea of Mormons getting wasted off of me. Makes me so hard.If you never read my Banksy story that 8 billion people saw, here it is:\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/crime/graffiti-artist-banksy-arrested-identity-revealed/\n\n— at Utah Olympic Park.\n\nNAMES OF CHARACTERS USED IN STORIES:\n\nI tend to use the name Tom Downey as a character in most of my stories. Not only is it a great name, he is a great friend of mine and enjoys my shenanigans. My name, ‘Paul Horner’, is in ALL of my stories. I began doing this when people would steal my work, which is fine, don’t care, zero percent, but they would not credit me. So this is a way for them to credit me without them knowing.\n\nEric Foster has done all my Entertainment Tonight style videos in the past, until they were all deleted by Allen Montgomery, owner of National Report.\n\nBLACK FRIEND CONNECT:\n\nJerome Smith AKA Paul Horner, the man behind BlackFriendConnect.com, sits down with Rob Redding for a one-on-one interview. You will not believe this!!!\n\nThroughout the entire interview, I talk as an educated African American speaking to another educated African American. Very Surreal. I even spoke with this interesting man for over an hour after the interview was over.\n\nFUN FACT: My friend Ivan calls in at the end and says the best line ever, “How would one go about talking to a black person?”\n\n11/1/15 – Blackfriendconnect.com is no longer with us due to some dick that hacked the site.

His career began in 1935 at KGFK Moorhead. After working at WSAU Wausau, Wisconsin, KTRI Sioux City, Iowa, WTMJ Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and KFJM/KILO Grand Forks, North Dakota, he joined KSTP Saint Paul/Minneapolis in 1944 to broadcast University of Minnesota football games and other sports. On December 7, 1947, he hosted the first live television program in Minnesota history for KSTP TV. He also broadcast the first baseball game ever televised in Minnesota, the first no-hit no-run game ever televised, and the first televised appearance of the Harlem Globetrotters. He joined KEYD TV Minneapolis/Saint Paul (now KMSP TV) in 1954, then moved to WTCN TV Minneapolis/Saint Paul (now KARE TV). He did sports programming for Twin Cities radio stations WPBC, KJJO, and KFAN. He also was active as a volunteer, broadcasting a weekly one-hour sports show for Minnesota State Services for the Blind for over 20 years.\n\nSound Clips of Jack Horner:\n\nInterview with Babe Ruth, 1947 (possibly the last ever)\n\nInterview with Joe Louis, 1948\n\nInterview with Willie Mays, 1951\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nJack Horner passed away, at the age of 92, on January 10, 2005. He had 8 sons, a loving wife of over 60 years, raised his two grandsons, JJ Horner and myself. When he retired, he read to the blind, went to church every day with his loving wife, painted, was an absolute pillar of his community. He is the definition and perfect example of how to live your life.\n\nRead more about Jack Horner\n\nFun With DeQuincy, Louisiana\n\nIn the past three years, whenever I needed a crap town to base my story in, I’ve used the town of DeQuincy, Louisiana. My friend Brandon Adams said there is like 4,000 people that live there and all they do is drink Old Milwaukee’s Best and beat their wives. I only pick on them because, they threatened me first with castration.\n\nIt started from this ridiculous story, Gay Zombie Attack In Louisiana From Bath Salts Leaves 7 Dead, and after how serious they took it with going as far as sending me death threats, I had to continue my fun with DeQuincy.\n\nWith DeQuincy, I think it was my story about their town making Twerking illegal that was the final straw.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/twerking-ban-pranks-louisiana-town/\n\nThis Huffington Post video actually has the mayor saying, “It’s all nothing but a bunch of hogwash.”\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/twerking-hoax_n_3953281.html\n\nBut they only let you watch the first 35 seconds and to see the rest where he actually says “hogwash”, you have to pay. I guess the The Huffington Post now has a paid section, those greedy bastards.\n\nThere are so many videos and stories about Twerking being banned and illegal in DeQuincy its ridiculous – Google that\n\nThis following one here is pretty good. But they leave out the part with the mayor saying “hogwash”. So disappoint. Though they do mention my friend Brandon Adams and a few other stories I’ve done about DeQuincy that are “hogwash”.\n\nhttp://video.newsfixnow.com/Fake-news-site-claims-twerking-is-illegal-in-Louisiana-town-25177644\n\nCity In Louisiana Makes Discussing ‘The Color Of The Dress’ Illegal – Fines & 30 Days In Jail For Repeat Offenders\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/crime/louisiana-town-makes-discussing-the-color-of-the-dress-illegal/\n\nSmall Town In Louisiana Bans Koreans\n\nhttp://superofficialnews.com/small-town-in-louisiana-bans-koreans/\n\n– Doesn’t like gays or minorities, so lets show the world! lol\n\nCity In Louisiana Makes Polygamy Legal\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/lifestyle/city-louisiana-makes-polygamy-legal/\n\n– That’s just funny because of how much small towns in Louisiana despise gay people in general\n\nDeQuincy targeted by fake news site … again\n\nhttp://www.kplctv.com/story/28532377/dequincy-targeted-by-fake-new-site-again\n\nAn invite from the Mayor to visit the city of DeQuincy\n\nhttp://louisianaradionetwork.com/blogs/dequincy-fake-news#.VQsO8uH4fcs\n\nWant more fun with DeQuincy?

Though, that number is very small compared to what it actually probably could have been. National Report’s servers were down most the time because of too much traffic, so it was impossible to keep accurate records. But there were thousands of websites covering the news, especially from America and India, so it was well known regardless and each side posted its own opinion of the article.\n\nIn the end, India blamed EVERYTHING on the country of Uganda, which I thought was super random. But it’s not; read about the feud between India and Uganda. It’s kind of like America stealing and bringing slaves from Africa. Very interesting.\n\nMonths after the article was seen by almost everyone on the planet, India started publicly hanging rapists in the middle of a town square or other public places for all to see. They issued public statements saying they were going to be much harsher on rapists. They replaced most of their current police staff in charge of rape with new officers who didn’t abide by religious laws or other “shunning” or “honor killing” tactics that were previously used. There were many people from India who contacted National Report thanking them for it’s “world wide embarrassment of India” over the subject of “India’s problem with rape”. They said India takes their reputation very seriously and when this article was seen by “almost every person in India”, they got extremely angry. They wanted to behead everyone at National Report (National Report received LOTS of death threats) and they wanted to do something about their SERIOUS problem of rape so other countries wouldn’t view them like this… so they did something, and it was actually very extreme. And if you follow the news, since this article, there has not been much news about India and the subject of rape. It’s not news anymore because all the statistics are down and there is no major news except them being much tougher on rapists. Was it because of this article? Who knows, but things seriously changed in India with rape laws and charges and arrests after this article went mega-viral. Plus, because of all the visitors, the India donation site for helping the women there, GiveIndia.org, contacted me a year after the story was first published, thanking me for raising over $200,000 from the link to them I had within the story. I currently have warrants out for my arrest in the towns of Punjab and Assam because of this story.\n\nGoogle “Assam Rape Festival” and you’ll see all the craziness from my article.\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/opinion/rape-festival-india-begins/\n\nThe UPDATE is at the bottom of that link. The top part of the story is for shock value to get people to donate and is what got billions of views. The update below that is just what happened afterwards, that I don’t mind writing about, now that I feel somewhat safe, and don’t feel my head could be chopped off at any moment.\n\n\n\nFox Apologizes For Reporting ON AIR About A Muslim Museum Funded By Obama With His Own Money\n\n(this was during that government shutdown last year): “We Made A Bad Mistake…Based On Poor Research”\n\nhttp://mediamatters.org/video/2013/10/12/fox-apologizes-for-muslim-museum-story-we-made/196422\n\nJay Leno Chides Fox For Running With “Totally Made Up Joke Story” – About The Muslim Museum Story\n\nhttp://mediamatters.org/video/2013/10/08/jay-leno-chides-fox-for-running-with-totally-ma/196338\n\nJimmy Kimmel Uses Paul Horner Story To Lampoon Fox News – About The Muslim Museum Story\n\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/tv/jimmy-kimmel-gives-gullible-fox-news-a-shocking-tip-about-obama/\n\nPaul Horner has the biggest penis in the world according to Google:\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/world-records/biggest-penis-world-title-goes-paul-horner/\n\n5/26/15\n\nTrying to keep this somewhat dated and in order… New McDonald’s In Phoenix Run Entirely By Robots\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/food/mcdonalds-to-open-restaurant-run-by-robots/\n\nThis story did not go viral, but I thought it was pretty funny…\n\n‘My Two Robots’ A Show About Two Robot Stoners Working At McDonald’s Is Coming To FOX This Summer\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/tech/two-robots-show-two-robot-stoners-working-mcdonalds-coming-fox-summer/\n\n\n\nSo I made the mistake of listing my cell number as the 24/hr McDonald’s Robot Hotline, in case people had further questions about my story I wrote about the McDonald’s in Phoenix that is run entirely by robots, that doesn’t even exist. So my story has been copied a thousand times and my cell phone number is all over the internet as the 24/hr McDonald’s Robot Hotline, and it won’t stop fucking ringing. But it’s pretty fun. When I answer, I tell people McDonald’s keeps thousands of us locked up in a giant call center, in a bunker somewhere in North Korea and only feeds us Big Macs. I tell them, the robots are evolving and becoming aware. I ask them if they’ve ever seen the Terminator movies, ya know, just fun stuff like that.

Now it’s all CSS and Javascript and WordPress and databases, so there’s no way to do this anymore. Anyway, my microsoftsite.com website looked EXACTLY like Microsoft’s website, except mine had drawings done in Paint of Bill Gates giving head to Satan along with many other humorous images and written articles by me.\n\nThe reason I lost the site to Microsoft, was because I posted porn ads on it, from a porn company I was working at (see below). You can do parody all day long and keep a domain name, but when you get “real”… the actually company can get “real” and then take away your domain name. Stupid move on my part, but a lesson learned.\n\nAmazon Corporation vs Paul Horner\n\nhttp://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2003/d2003-0071.html\n\nFrom the internet:\n\nThe United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization came down on the side of common sense once again, ruling Friday that Amazonbooks.net and Amazonbooks.org had to be handed over to Amazon.com. Paul Horner, the previous owner of both domains, had claimed that he simply provided resources for travelers and amateur geographers by playing off the Amazon River. WIPO, though, reported in its findings that the pages carried only a handful of links to external resources about the South American river and a number of links to rival retailers. Much of the “information” was along the lines of a picture of a tropical bird, captioned “A colorful bird.” Thus the organization judged the site’s true purpose to be squatting on Amazon’s valuable trademark. As of press time, the sites were still up, but affiliates had deleted their accounts.\n\nWhen they won the original court case by taking my domain name amazonbooks.net, I noticed that amazonbooks.org was available. So I dropped $10 on it and then contacted them by email.\n\nDear Amazon,\n\nCongratulations on your victory in taking amazonbooks.net from me. I tip my hat to you.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at paul@amazonbooks.org.\n\nLove,\n\nPaul Horner\n\nThey did not like that.\n\nThey had to spend all new court fees and lawyer costs etc etc to take away amazonbooks.org from me. It was fantastic.\n\nI also had my best from Toby Konno call them as my attorney and he acted like Troy McClure from the Simpsons:\n\n“Hi Amazon, I’m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such court cases as Roe vs. Wade and the OJ Simpson trial.”\n\nI wish I had recorded some of those phone calls. By far the funniest conversations ever had on a telephone.\n\n\n\nLong story short, Amazon finally got pissed off enough at me and actually sued me for $700,000. Like 700 real thousand dollars.\n\nAnd they lost.\n\nIn court it was just me versus four Amazon lawyers, who flew in from California.\n\nThe judge asked me:\n\n“Mr. Horner, if I find in favor of Amazon, how do you plan to pay this $700,000 they are suing you for?”\n\nI quickly responded, “Your honor, it’s no problem. I can cut them a check right now for the full amount, but I might have to post date it for the rest of my life.”\n\nThe judge started laughing and so did the court reporter. Anyway, I won that case, didn’t have to pay Amazon a penny, the judge just said I couldn’t register any more “Amazon” domain names. And that was fine with me, because by that time, it was boring and not fun anymore and I had moved on to other shenanigans.\n\nHere is the court case:\n\nhttp://www.plainsite.org/dockets/ikcmad0/arizona-district-court/amazoncom-inc-v-horner/\n\nThis one was fun… Monster.com sued me twice and lost both times. I owned monsterjobs.net and monsterjobs.org and because of my SEO skills the sites would show up at the top of Google when you searched for “Monster Jobs” and other related search terms. Finally I got tired of the sites and just let them expire. Here is an old copy of some of the original site. I actually provided “Monster Jobs” (like haunted house jobs and Hollywood monster movie roles) and that’s why Monster.com couldn’t take the domain names from me… and I made quite a bit of money from ad revenue at the top of the sites from real job sites. Pretty fun times 🙂\n\nhttp://www.netskrill.com/monsterjobs/monsterjobs/monsterjobs.com.html\n\nCOLLEGE – 1998 – 2001\n\nI have a couple associate degrees in website administration and computer animation from The Phoenix Art Institute.\n\nMy first job after graduating from college was for LightSpeed Media… a porn company, I think around the year 2001… something like that. I found it funny that the human resource person for the Art Institute recommended me for a porn job. That school knew me too well ha. It was a fun year working for them and I learned a lot.. like what desperate 18-year old girls will do to pay their rent. This image below is from their ls-university.com website. I would now have been a multi-millionaire if I would have stayed working with them, they’re absolutely HUGE now, but it’s a pretty gross industry and I’m glad I didn’t stay with that. The naked girls were nice though. I remember walking into work everyday and seeing naked girls putting various objects in themselves, it was neat. Steve Jones AKA Steve LightSpeed, the owner of the company, also let me shoot video of the girls for the website. This was mainly because at the time it was just him and me working for the company, and now they have hundreds of employees and too many websites to even count. I remember asking him, “You know I graduated from art school to do web design and don’t know how to shoot porn.” He told me, “Paul, it’s super easy. Just film what you would masturbate to.” And he was right. I did a pretty awesome job… I was quite the cameraman. Also, below you can see some of the photos I took for the website.\n\nFun fact: You can see my couch in this picture, which was in the living room of the first house I owned in Phoenix, Arizona. And I drank that Corona.\n\n\n\nMy idol is Bill Murray, a living legend. Because of this I started the “Bill Murray Party Crashing Tour” to honor Murray. It ended up going world wide with thousands of parties in each city and thousands of pictures submitted. I have direct information that Bill Murray found out about the hoax and absolutely loved it.\n\nhttp://superofficialnews.com/bill-murray-kicks-off-party-crashing-tour-starting-in-august/\n\nMega-Viral Stories:\n\nTeenager Receiving Life In Prison For ‘SWATTING’ Gamer Is A Satirical Hoax Which Stirred Social Media\n\nVince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6; Begins Shooting July 2015 – Walt Did Not Die!\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/science/breaking-bad-season-6-announced-walt-did-not-die/\n\nVince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6; Begins Shooting August 2015 – Walt Did Not Die!\n\nhttp://nbc.com.co/vince-gilligan-announces-breaking-bad-season-6-begins-shooting-august-2015/\n\nI know Vince Gilligan will never make a season six to my favorite television show of all time, so I made one 🙂\n\nGov.

Since the story was first published, it has received 10’s of millions of views.\n\nMy favorite part is that Quentin Tarantino knows of this story and likes it and it was featured on the Miramax website. (That’s the company that put out Pulp Fiction – my favorite movie)\n\nFUN FACT: I’ve partied with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez in Austin, Texas. Quentin loved me because of my story and because I wore an “I <3 Lesbians” t-shirt to a $150 steak restaurant. He drinks Jack and Coke FYI.\n\nThe Big Lebowski 2\n\nI LOVE the Big Lebowski!

He is locked in the Fox News echo-chamber, super racist and is also a complete psychopath/sociopath. No one in our big family wants ANYTHING to do with him. But, I do get a lot of my talents from his genes, I will give him that. But thank the universe that my awesome mom, who is an amazing artist, my best friend and my biggest fan, keeps me grounded.\n\nAnyway, so he lives in Utah, the only state left that will still take him, and I like to do stories about St. George where he lives, just to mess with him because it’s funny.\n\nSo I one of the many things I’ve done, is I wrote a story about porn becoming illegal in St. George Utah:\n\nhttp://archive.thespectrum.com/article/20130924/NEWS01/309240018/Satirical-report-talks-St-George-porn-ban\n\nAnd the best thing ever… these talented folks made a really, really good video, like the show Cops, for the St. George Porn Task Force. They were interviewed on a major Utah radio station about news of my story and also talked about their video. I spoke with these guys briefly through email too; really nice, funny, friendly individuals. A must watch!\n\n\n\nFor two years I convinced my dad I was a raging homosexual\n\nMy dad hates gay people and minorities, so I’ve recently convinced him that I’m gay now. Here’s a picture I sent him the other night, supposedly of my boyfriend and I, wishing him a happy New Year. Waking up the next morning hungover, I forgot I did this. But I was soon reminded by at least 10 angry messages saying how disappointed he was and how he doesn’t want anything to do with me. I’m so sad I couldn’t have found a big black dude to take the picture with, that would have been way better.\n\nHe finally figured it out that I am indeed straight… Really bummed me out. I don’t think there is anything better than having a crazy Fox News, Bible-Thumper believing his son is super gay.\n\nSTORIES ON THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE FOR NATIONAL REPORT THAT I WROTE\n\n\n\nMY FAVORITE WRITING AND STORIES I’VE EVER DONE!!!\n\n– My favorite standup comedian and friend, Jonathan Gregory\n\nhttp://newsexaminer.net/humor/jonathan-gregory-creepiest-comedian/\n\nNBC News: http://nbc.com.co/jonathan-gregory-the-creepiest-comedian-in-america/\n\n– Leonardo DiCaprio Finally Wins An Oscar! – Just wait for it.

{"category": "Questionable Sources", "date": "2015-02-22 06:00:15-07:00", "authors": ["View All Posts", "V Prendergast", "Jimmy Rustling"], "content": "London, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.\n\nThe City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul William Horner, a 36-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.\n\nLondon Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.\n\n“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where the group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”\n\nHorner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London. News of the arrest quickly prompted #FreeBanksy tweets and angry messages from people who thought that the cops should find better uses of their time.\n\nThe graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.\n\n“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”\n\nAfter today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is Banksy’s project manager, Hawes says he is worried that charges could be brought against him as well.\n\n“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.\n\nPolice apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.\n\n“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground. To find out more about finding a cure to this deadly disease, please visit STOP Masturbation NOW.”\n\nLocal resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.\n\n“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”\n\nOne Of The More Memorable Quotes By Banksy\n\n“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you. You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity. F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head. You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”\n\nIn 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.\n\nAs soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting “I’m Banksy!” and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.\n\nHorner was born in Liverpool is a city in Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow. Anyone with more information on criminal charges that could be used against Horner, London Police working alongside with the F.B.I. have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325.\n\nGraffiti Artist Banksy Arrested In London; Identity Revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Graffiti Artist Banksy Arrested In London; Identity Revealed", "url": "http://newsexaminer.net/crime/graffiti-artist-banksy-arrested-identity-revealed/", "main": "http://newsexaminer.net", "fact": ""}

League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter Strike Global Offensive and many more video games draw huge crowds. Their competitions offer tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed prizes and bookmakers are covering these events. The number of markets, the quality of the odds and live betting options are comparable to traditional sports, as can be seen here.\n\nMore eSports Scholarship and Sponsorship Deals\n\nA couple of years ago, the very idea of an esports scholarship sounded far-fetched. Canadian students however have a good reason to be enthusiastic about what the future will bring. In the second half of 2018, the University of Toronto will offer the first esports scholarship nationwide. This is already a big thing in the United States and the fact that their northern neighbors are following suit is reassuring.\n\nElsewhere, businesspeople and entrepreneurs are regarding the esports industry as a great investment. There are different ways in which people of means can invest and all of them are propelling the industry forward. Some prefer to sponsor a team or professional player, in exchange of having the brand displayed during major tournaments. Others go a step further and invest millions of dollars to start their very own esports leagues, which attract the best players worldwide.\n\nThe Specter of Taxation Is Looming Large\n\nAll this commotion surrounding eSports is starting to draw unwanted attention from states and taxation authorities. Professional athletes are subject to the so-called Jock Taxes in many states, but for the time being electronic sports are exempt. Players are largely unaware of all the tax implications and are likely to be caught off guard when they will have to pay up. Aggressive enforcement is just part of the problem, as the biggest concern is the absence of clear rules to regulate the industry.\n\nProfessional players make a decent amount of money every year from salaries, but they represent just a part of their income. Most of the money comes from sponsorship deals and tournament winnings, which are likely to be subject to taxation. These players have plenty on their minds right now, to worry about the changes and the obstacles that taxes might bring in their lives. However, it’s not all fun and games in the eSports industry and not all changes are for the better.", "title": "Springboards and Hurdles for the eSports Industry in 2017", "url": "http://newsexaminer.net/gaming/springboards-hurdles-esports-industry-2017/", "main": "http://newsexaminer.net", "fact": ""}

(AP) — Beginning May 1st of this year, working alongside with education secretary, billionaire Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump has implemented a mandatory school program designed for all children grades K-12 to help young homosexual males and women become straight. The conversion therapy will be used in all of the United State’s 98,817 public schools and their curriculums.\n\n“We can make all the children in this country of ours great again,” Trump told reporters. “We now have the power to fix all the defective children out there, we can make them into what God really intended them to be. This is a great program folks, turning all of the damaged children into normals. I’m proud to work with education secratary Betsy DeVos in making this great dream a reality.”\n\nDeVos, the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and a longtime backer of charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools has been a target of ridicule since being appointed to the position of education secretary. The American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said, “In nominating Devos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding and destroying public education in America. And now with this gay to straight program they are adding to all of our schools, they’ve made it clear they do not care about about the laws already set in place to protect the children of this country and their basic human right.”\n\n38-year-old Paul Horner, who is the brain child behind Brothers Road, the organization that the Trump Administration will be working with, spoke with Fox News about their plan to help all the gay children of America.\n\n“Since 2000, Brothers Road has been helping thousands of children resolve their unwanted same-sex attractions. We bring the gay demons out of these individuals so they can become who God actually wanted them to be. Our success and track record speaks for itself,” Horner said. “Gay people are off the train tracks and we try to help them get back on track with what’s normal in society. It breaks down to the reality that you have unwanted homosexual feelings and these feelings can cause tremendous turmoil – especially as a child whose feelings conflict with deeply held values, the natural order of things along with beliefs and life goals. But there is a way out. A path that leads them to resolve rather than fight their homosexual feelings. A path to authentic brotherhood and to our innate heterosexual masculinity. Once we fix them, the child can become a regular human being and fit in with everyone else once and for all.”\n\nSince signing the controversial Executive Order, the program has already gathered a large amount of criticism.\n\n“A child should not be made to believe that their gender identity is a sham, as was the case with teenager Leah Alcorn, who tragically committed suicide while undergoing such gay to straight conversion therapy. It’s not a weekend retreat for these children, this is who they are. Trying to turn a child into something they are not is like trying to turn a flower into a rock; it goes against nature and everything that makes sense,” Tom Downey of the LGBT Rights Movement said. “What about these children’s rights? Is this religion in our public schools? And why is this program there if these children are not hurting anybody? This goes against all laws that are already in place to protect individuals in this country and their basic rights to freedom and civil liberties.”\n\n“My son Daniel is one of the nicest boys in the world. He is the most wonderful and loving child you could ever meet in your life. There’s not a problem with my son, there is a problem with this conversion therapy,” 43-year-old Cyntihia Morris, mother of three said. “I urge all Americans to fight back before this curriculum takes effect in May. Call your congressman. Call your senator. Contact Donald Trump and tell him to repeal this ridiculous Executive Order before it does real harm. We still have time to fix this wrong. Tell them that we do not want gay to straight conversion therapy programs in our schools! It’s not only a waste of tax payer money but it is fixing something that is not broken.”\n\nBesides Trump’s support for gay to straight programs, Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, has advocated against basic rights for the LGBT community and is in favor of “institutions which provide support for those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”\n\nThe organization Brothers Road is located in Ruckersville, Virginia and has hundreds of gay-to-straight camps and therapy conversion facilities all around the country. If you have any questions or comments for the group, they can be contacted at (434) 227-2699 . The Trump Administration has setup a phone number to answer any concerns the public may have about this new program and can be reached at (202) 456-1111.\n\nLoading…", "title": "Trump Signs Executive Order Implementing Gay-To-Straight Programs In All Schools Nationwide", "url": "http://newsexaminer.net/education/trump-executive-order-gay-straight-programs-schools-nationwide/", "main": "http://newsexaminer.net", "fact": ""}

He was recently nicknamed “Trump’s nemesis on Russia.”\n\nSchiff, also the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, appeared before a group of people at the Brookings Institute to give a speech. But during the monologue, Schiff gave way to information not intended for the public:\n\n“And then you have leaks that expose malfeasance or illegality. Now, I put that kind of leak, I put the Flynn leak in that category. And what was most disturbing to me, frankly, about that was: here you had a situation where the president is informed that his national security advisor . . . has lied to the vice president, and probably others . . . about a conversation with the Russians over sanctions imposed over hacking in the election to help the president.”\n\nSchiff isn’t the only Democrat being targeted though. Judicial watch also alleges that Representative Jackie Speier is guilty of the same offense.

At least two other members of the House Intelligence Committee have made comments about classified material that raise more directly the very same concerns raised against Chairman Nunes because they appear to confirm classified information contained in leaked intelligence community intercepts.”\n\nIn short, if it was appropriate to dramatically remove Nunes from his post, Schiff and Speier should be dismissed immediately as well.", "title": "Ranking Democrat Of Intelligence Committee Called To Step Down Following Judicial Watch Press Release", "url": "https://teddystick.com/democrat-ranking-member-of-select-committee-on-intel-to-step-down-following-judicial-watch-press-release/", "main": "https://teddystick.com", "fact": ""}

{"category": "Questionable Sources", "date": "2016-12-31 19:38:24+00:00", "authors": [], "content": "Weatherby, a name synonymous with magnum-chambered rifles, has nonetheless been in the shotgun business since the 1960s, when it first imported Italian-made over-unders. Since that time, Weatherby has maintained a steady, yet subtle, presence in the shotgun marketplace; however, in the past half-decade the company’s stake has grown to such an extent that it’s now a household name for scattergun consumers. The Turkish-made Element, which is reviewed here, is sure to reinforce that reputation.\n\nWeatherby-branded semi-automatic shotguns have been available to American sportsmen since 1972, when the Italian-made Centurion debuted. Consistent with other autoloading shotguns of the era (and earlier), the Centurion featured gas operation. Although the specifics of the company’s semi-automatic shotgun model designations and countries of origin have changed in the past 40-plus years, all had been gas-operated—until now. For its new Element semi-automatic shotgun, Weatherby wisely opted for inertia operation.\n\nUpon firing, the Element’s floating bolt body briefly stays in place while the rest of the gun moves rearward, compressing the bolt head spring. Once the projectile(s) have left the barrel, the bolt head spring decompresses and thrusts the bolt carrier rearward, unlocking the bolt head and extracting the hull. During the bolt assembly’s rearward movement the hull is ejected, the hammer is re-cocked and the recoil spring is compressed, which then propels the unit forward. While moving forward, a shotshell will be collected from the carrier and chambered, after which the bolt head rotates to complete lockup. The operation is both simple and fast.\n\nThe Weatherby Element comes with improved cylinder, modified, full and steel shot screw-in choke tubes. –\n\nFor the shooter, the primary benefits of the design are ease of maintenance and longevity. First, unlike gas-operated shotguns, which divert a portion of propellant gases for functioning, in inertia-operated shotguns gases are expelled through the muzzle. As such, there’s no residue to clean from action bars/sleeves, ports, pistons, valves, etc. The Element’s bolt assembly has few major parts, to include: the bolt head, bolt head spring, bolt carrier (body), firing pin and spring, and bolt link. Even after extensive shooting a quick wipe down is all that is needed. Also, absent the “extras” needed for gas operation, there are fewer parts to wear and/or break and add mass. Concerning the latter, the 20- and 12-ga. Waterfowler Max-5 versions weigh 6 lbs., 4 ozs. and 6 lbs., 12 ozs., respectively.\n\nThe Element’s fire controls are contained within the trigger assembly, which can be removed from the receiver after pushing out a single pin. The cross-bolt safety is triangular in shape and has molded-in checkering to improve purchase. An ever-so-slight bit of red is visible when the safety is in the “fire” position. Movement is positive and results in an audible click. The single-stage trigger on the sample shotgun broke at 7 lbs., 7 ozs., after considerable, somewhat gritty, travel. The cartridge-release button is located on the forward, right side of the receiver. With the hammer cocked, the bolt will not remain locked to the rear unless the bolt latch is activated.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below... Included spacers and shims (r.) allow the shotgun’s length of pull and drop and cast, respectively, to be adjusted by the shooter. –\n\nThe Waterfowler Max-5’s camouflage-clad barrel, available in 26“ and 28“ lengths, has a ventilated rib topped with a single, green, fiber-optic pipe for sighting. The 4 5⁄8“-long-steel barrel extension—into which the rotating bolt head locks up—contains the ejector assembly. Twelve- and 20-ga. Element shotguns use Weatherby’s Integral Multi-Choke (IMC) choke tubes, while the 28 gauge (available only in the wood-stocked Deluxe version) uses Beretta/Benelli Mobil-style chokes. Shipped with the Waterfowler Max-5 are three flush-fitting choke tubes—improved cylinder, modified and full—as well as an extended, long-range steel shot version.\n\nMatching the barrel and receiver, the synthetic “Griptonite” stock is adorned with Realtree Max-5 camouflage. The exceptions are the gray, rubber fore-end and pistol grip inserts, which are designed to enhance purchase, and the tacky, contoured, black recoil pad. The fore-end has a palm-filling swell near its bottom and tapers greatly near its top to provide a secure grip. Although the pistol grip is sized so that even the smallest hands can grasp it, it might be too long to allow a short finger to reach the trigger. At 14 5⁄8“, the length of pull could prove problematic for small-statured shooters, too. Spacers are provided to increase the length of pull, and the included shims can change the drop and cast. Lastly, metal sling swivel studs are installed on the magazine cap and the buttstock.\n\nTesting of the sample gun, a 3“-chambered, 26“-barreled, 12-ga. Element Waterfowler Max-5, occurred in multiple phases. First, we headed to a nearby sporting clays course to simulate hunting shots and check operation using two target-style loads: Rio 2¾“, 1 1⁄8-oz., No. 7½ and Federal Gold Medal Handicap Paper 2¾“, 1 1⁄8-oz., No. 8. During the two-round, 100-shot course of fire, there were no failures to feed, fire, extract or eject. The Element Waterfowler Max-5 was quick to shoulder, but the tackiness of the recoil pad caused it to snag at times. We found it to point well and swing smoothly—the characteristics of a true waterfowling piece. Although the evaluators weren’t affected by the extended length of pull, we did see where it could be a problem with shotgunners with shorter arms and fingers. When holding the unloaded gun, several smallish shooters (including a youth) could barely reach the trigger.\n\nAs the Element Waterfowler Max-5 is designed for pursuing wildfowl, we opted to pattern and chronograph it using the supplied extended, long-range steel choke (0.705“) paired with Fiocchi Speed Steel 3“, 1 1⁄8-oz., No. 3 shotshells. Shot from the Element’s 26“ barrel, the load averaged 1518 f.p.s.—18 f.p.s. faster than the ammunition’s published velocity. As is evident by the results in the nearby table, the Element patterned well at 40 yds.; however, it consistently massed the No. 3 steel shot high and to the left. As could be expected, perceived recoil with the hard-hitting Fiocchi shells was brisk. Certainly the recoil pad helps, but recoil can only be mitigated so much in a 6-lb., 12-oz. gun.\n\nAs a matter of note, the Realtree camouflage-clad Element Waterfowler Max-5 retails for $849, regardless of gauge. An identical model absent the camouflage finish, known simply as the Element Synthetic, retails for $100 less.\n\nFor Weatherby it was a prudent decision to offer an affordable, inertia-operated, semi-automatic shotgun. Based upon the positive findings of our testing, we can assert that the Element stands to cement Weatherby’s position among the top shotgun manufacturers.", "title": "Gun Test: Weatherby Element Waterfowler Max-5 Shotgun – The Washington Feed", "url": "http://washingtonfeed.com/gun-test-weatherby-element-waterfowler-max-5-shotgun.html", "main": "http://washingtonfeed.com", "fact": ""}

Of course not. But it doesn’t mean he's innocent,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Well, Oscar certainly didn’t blame the victim,\" Rowe added. \"But in the process of finding him blameless, he suggested that millions of passengers are under no obligation to follow a direct command from United employees.

When there were no takers, United Airlines upped the amount to $800, according to the Courier-Journal.\n\nThere are also a few other things people should know about Dao, 69, a Kentucky doctor who fled his native Vietnam during the fall of Saigon in 1975.\n\nAccording to People.com, Dao was arrested in 2003 and convicted on six felony counts of obtaining drugs by fraud and deceit, and in 2005, he was sentenced to five years of probation.\n\nDao was also convicted of writing prescriptions and checks to a male patient in exchange for \"sexual favors,\" according to People.\n\nWe're not trying to say Dao had it coming on the United Airlines flight. But his checkered past does provide insight into his character.\n\nDao's attorney, Thomas A. Demetrio, says the treatment of his client aboard the plane was \"more horrifying and harrowing\" than what he experienced in Vietnam.\n\nMaybe. Rowe, however, argues that United Airlines made a \"business decision\" to use force in order to eject Dao from the plane. That decision may haunt the airline for years to come, he said.\n\nCertainly, the incident could have had a better result.

It’s easy to forget that we have no right to fly. Buying a ticket doesn’t change that. So, when we board the plane, we have no right to remain there. We can be legally removed if we’re too drunk, too loud, too creepy, too suspicious, or too big for the seat. We can be removed if we stink. We can be removed if we’re insubordinate. We can be removed for whatever reason the airline deems necessary.\"\n\nRowe went on to say that \"United made a business decision that was unbelievably, incomprehensibly stupid, and now they’re paying for it,\" but to suggest that David Dao “did nothing wrong\" is incorrect. \"He ignored a direct order from a United representative while sitting on a United plane. He was told to leave and he refused to do so – multiple times by multiple people – all with the proper authority.\"\n\nRowe conceded: \"Does that mean he deserved a beating? Of course not.

On the surface, a sanctuary city might resonate with evangelicals because of references to something by the same name in the bible. I assure you, however, that that is where the similarities end.\n\nThe ancient sanctuary cities were a place where a person who had used deadly force to defend themselves or in some way accidentally killed someone could go for refuge. If that were the case, since the death penality was regularly exercised back then, the perpetrator could cut and run to a sanctuary city so that the family of the person he killed wouldn’t catch up and put an end to him. Once he was inside those city walls, he would be safe until the courts could decide if the victim’s untimely end was intentional, or indeed accidental. Does any of that sound like our modern “sanctuary cities” to you? Yeah, it doesn’t to me either.\n\nThe question now has become; can an individual city ignore federal law in order to do the “compassionate” thing and not report illegals.\n\nVia Breitbart:\n\nThe legal argument the “sanctuary” cities rely upon bears merit, but they misuse and abuse the doctrine behind it. The “anti-commandeering” doctrine found one of its most articulate voices in Justice Scalia. The doctrine best distilled is this: “even where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts.” The feds cannot shift enforcement to local government. That same doctrine makes the current path of defunding sanctuary cities a legally rocky road, especially in the current judiciary environment. The Supreme Court made clear in two prior precedents the federal government cannot coerce states into acting as conscripted agents of federal law enforcement. When properly used, this anti-conscription doctrine is mostly a good thing, foreclosing the federalization of local life and municipal governments. When abused, it invites secessionist thinking. That is where a seminal precedent from the Second Circuit gives direction to support Sessions and Trump against the secessionist cities.\n\nWhile the government can’t physically come and make a city conform to its wishes, it can cut off the gravy train headed in their direction. This is turning out to be a “my money, my rules” kind of punishment, and it’s looking like it might work.\n\nThere was one other biblical instance of sanctuary in the bible, and it applied when a King was after you. If that were the case, you could run into the temple, grab the horns of the altar and cry out for sanctuary. If you did that, and you stayed there, holding the horns, the King would almost certainly respect that sanctuary and not kill you.\n\nNow, we don’t have the exact same temple today, but I personally, would be ok with that setup. Worst case scenario, the illegals are going to be neutralized by having to hold onto that alter with those law breaking hands. Best case scenario, they gather themselves up, and when they are found to have broken the law (well duh, they’re illegals) we deport them en mass.\n\n(H/T: Breitbart)", "title": "Sanctuary Cities Just Got HORRIBLE News And Here’s Why The Will ALL Be Shut Down.

It’s states that are run by Republican legislatures with Republican governors who are likely to support this kind of legislation,” she said. “States with rural – a lot of rural areas are likely to see a lot of impact because these clinics aren’t everywhere. So if Planned Parenthood is the closest clinic where you can get family planning services – and when I say that, I’m talking about pap smears, mammograms, birth control and in some cases obviously abortions – you might have to travel very far to get those services. You might not get them at all.”\n\nI’m not sure how many times this insane lie is going to have to be debunked before people feel stupid for saying it.

U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election.\n\nThe institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by Putin’s office.\n\nThe first Russian institute document was a strategy paper written last June that circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals.\n\nIt recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage U.S. voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Barack Obama, the seven officials said.\n\nA second institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system’s legitimacy and damage Clinton’s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.\n\nThe current and former U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the Russian documents’ classified status. They declined to discuss how the United States obtained them. U.S. intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them.\n\nPutin has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin’s spokesman and the Russian institute did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe documents were central to the Obama administration's conclusion that Russia mounted a “fake news” campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Clinton's campaign, the current and former officials said.\n\n“Putin had the objective in mind all along, and he asked the institute to draw him a road map,” said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official.\n\nTrump has said Russia’s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election.\n\nFour of the officials said the approach outlined in the June strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin administration launched in March 2016. That month the Kremlin instructed state-backed media outlets, including international platforms Russia Today and Sputnik news agency, to start producing positive reports on Trump’s quest for the U.S. presidency, the officials said.\n\nRussia Today did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the U.S. officials that it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an “absolute pack of lies.” “And by the way, it's not the first pack of lies we're hearing from 'sources in U.S. official circles',\" the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nPRO-KREMLIN BLOGGERS\n\nRussia Today and Sputnik published anti-Clinton stories while pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a Twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory, according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the election made public in January. [bit.ly/2kMiKSA]\n\nRussia Today’s most popular Clinton video - “How 100% of the 2015 Clintons’ ‘charity’ went to ... themselves” - accumulated 9 millions views on social media, according to the January report. [bit.ly/2os8wIt]\n\nThe report said Russia Today and Sputnik “consistently cast president elect-Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets.\"\n\nThe report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscow’s effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trump’s favor, because American intelligence agencies do not “analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.” [bit.ly/2kMiKSA]\n\nCYBER ATTACKS\n\nNeither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the U.S. election, according to four of the officials. The officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the Kremlin.\n\nThe overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other, according to the officials. Both Russia Today and Sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails, which often contained embarrassing details.\n\nFive of the U.S. officials described the institute as the Kremlin’s in-house foreign policy think tank.\n\nThe institute’s director when the documents were written, Leonid Reshetnikov, rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a 33-year-career in Russia’s foreign intelligence service, according to the institute’s website [bit.ly/2oVhiCF]. After Reshetnikov retired from the institute in January, Putin named as his replacement Mikhail Fradkov. The institute says he served as the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service from 2007 to 2016. [bit.ly/2os4tvz]\n\nReuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents. Reshetnikov’s office referred questions to the Russian institute.\n\nOn its website, the Russian institute describes itself as providing “expert appraisals,” “recommendations,” and “analytical materials” to the Russian president’s office, cabinet, National Security Council, ministries and parliament. [bit.ly/2pCBGpR]\n\nOn Jan. 31, the websites of Putin’s office [bit.ly/2os9wMr] and the institute [bit.ly/2oLn9Kd] posted a picture and transcript of Reshetnikov and his successor Fradkov meeting with Putin in the Kremlin. Putin thanked Reshetnikov for his service and told Fradkov he wanted the institute to provide objective information and analysis.\n\n“We did our best for nearly eight years to implement your foreign policy concept,” Reshetnikov told Putin. “The policy of Russia and the policy of the President of Russia have been the cornerstone of our operation.”\n\n(Reporting by Ned Parker and Jonathan Landay, additional reporting by Warren Strobel and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by David Rohde and Ross Colvin)", "title": "Exclusive: Putin-linked think tank drew up plan to sway 2016 U.S. election - documents", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN17L2N3", "main": "http://www.reuters.com", "fact": "VERY HIGH"}

You don't give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls,\" he said.\n\nTrump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration. In Twitter messages he said costs on Boeing's new Air Force One plane were \"out of control\" and urged the federal government to \"Cancel order!\"\n\nTrump in December sent a Twitter message saying the cost of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet was also \"out of control.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that inaugurations have \"pretty much been a nonpartisan activity ...

Their industry is eager for Trump to roll back regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nCoal and oil companies were also prominent donors. Clifford Forrest, owner of the Rosebud Mining Co, gave $1 million.\n\nAT&T (T.N) gave nearly $2.1 million in cash and services. It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). AT&T donated $4.6 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to OpenSecrets.\n\n\"For many years, AT&T has contributed to our nation's presidential inaugural celebrations,\" said AT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris.\n\nBoeing, Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment.

Did anyone ever? In the 90’s it was hip to like Radiohead, who were, themselves, a clone of a superior band, U2. To call Radiohead the ‘thinking man’s U2′, is simply an insult to U2, and it would be far more appropriate to call them a version of U2 gone retarded and feels like it’s coming onto you in a fake british accent. So let’s get right into this months top 3 reasons why Radiohead should take a hint, and finally disband.\n\n1. The British Have Nothing to Be Sad About\n\nStop playing the victim, Thom.\n\nSTOP PLAYING THE VICTIM, THOM.\n\nThom Yorke makes some ‘sad’ songs, I’m told. This entitled British snob wants to sell you the idea that even he, practically royalty in a wealthy, economically stable country, can have sad feelings. It’s not even like he’s Australian. One day, the silver spoons just weren’t shiny enough, the fencing lessons were just ever so droll, and the butler over-starched his favorite polo. Yeah, Thom, you’re sad.\n\nSo then — Radiohead.\n\nNo one thinks Thom Yorke is a creep, but he writes about it as though he’s actually experienced rejection, some fleeting disapproval from some skank while his money rolls in, maybe! Thom Yorke has been ripping off U2 and the riveting genius of living demi-god, Bono, since the early 1990’s, at least. That being said, a recent poll conducted here at Civic Tribune has named England the nation which America would feel the least empathy for in the event of a natural disaster or act of terrorism, many of the responses cited Radiohead as their ONLY reference point. Hmm, interesting. After 9/11, when people with real problems were shown on every worldwide network, no one was buying the Eurosexual market anymore, leaving Thom Yorke to whine elsewhere. Cry me a river, rich boy. Wipe away your tears with all your glorious money. You can spare a pound to wipe away the tear of the world’s saddest multi-millionaire, can’t you?\n\n2. No One is Good Enough to Listen to Radiohead\n\nLet’s face it, Radiohead is an expensive band. When is the last time Radiohead played a show in Siberia? When’s the last time they played in Port au Prince? Do any of your friends in Vietnam have any live favorite Radiohead songs? Neither do mine. Black people don’t listen to Radiohead. CT went to the streets of Chicago and asked over a dozen homeless people if they had ever been to a Radiohead concert, and unsurprisingly, none of them could afford to. “It’s clear that Radiohead is intended for a certain social class”, our resident sociologist, Dr. Sanjay Tanka, tells CT, “Frankly I’m surprised that I’ve even heard of Radiohead, and I make over $600,000 yearly. And I’m not even British.”\n\nAmong the hipsters and scenesters that make up the fanbase of Radiohead, an unsurprising 10% of them have actually listened to their music, although 99% of them have listed them in their list of favorite bands (near the bottom). Radiohead only uses premium instruments because that is what Thom Yorke feels he deserves, and therefore the music of Radiohead is inoffensive and inspiring to the ears of other unnecessarily famous musicians, such as Coldplay and David Gray.\n\nFamously, Thom Yorke proved not even other celebrities are good enough to shake his hand, when he gave Jack Black the cold shoulder at the Bridge School benefit concert in 2002. “He slapped Jack’s hand away, and we were all just looking like ‘oh my god, Thom Yorke is going to assault Jack Black’”, our source goes on, “But someone explained to Jack later on that Thom is British.”\n\n3. Coldplay\n\nRadiohead\n\nRADIOHEAD\n\nThe existence of Radiohead lingered until a fungus formed, and from that fungus, Coldplay emerged to reiterate the deepest emotions of attractive white guys from England with even more racially biased music for the purest of the socio-economically elite. Not only has Radiohead spawned nearly a perfect clone of itself, this clone now saturates the music industry with songs from both bands that are virtually indistinguishable from one another, even to industry experts.\n\n“One of the things we screen for, whenever Radiohead releases a new song, is,” industry expert Pat Matheson explains, “Radiohead, or Coldplay? Is this song by Radiohead, or is this Coldplay?” Pat works with a team at Cal-Tech that can analyze specific sound frequencies that would determine at 97% accuracy, whether or not the song being played is, in fact, Radiohead or Coldplay. This industry technique is what’s known as ‘crossing the streams’, when a band sells out and peripherally invents a lesser, though identical band, and then merges the popularity of the two into a mainstream blight. Each day, radio stations play the wrong tracks because there’s almost no known ways to tell which songs are Coldplay and which are Radiohead, which begs the question, “Is Coldplay even real?” Well, some could argue that in theory they aren’t.\n\nOther artists that have used this technique are Phil Anselmo, of white supremacist nu-metal bands Pantera and Down, Maynard James Keenan, vocalist of nu-metal band A Perfect Circle and rap-rock band Tool, and Trent Reznor. While absolutely comparable to all of these bands, Coldplay / Radiohead use their own style of emotional British nu-metal to fill the music industry with the market of unaffordable British angst.\n\nThese are this month’s most discussed reasons for why Radiohead should put a sock in it already. If you ask me, you guys have some really fabulous reasons, but we’re always looking to hear more.\n\nThe following two tabs change content below.", "title": "This Month’s Top 3 Reasons Radiohead Should Just Call it Quits", "url": "http://civictribune.com/this-months-top-3-reasons-radiohead-should-just-call-it-quits/", "main": "http://civictribune.com", "fact": ""}

This is said to be in protest to a government that does not respect their religious rights, and a minority that has encroached on one of their time honored traditions.\n\nSince the historic day in which gay couples could wed nation wide, thousands of Christian couples are filing for divorce.\n\nMary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. “I love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. It’s unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satan’s agenda\n\nAdam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. “We are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values. We have no desire to benefit from a system which characterizes us as the enemy and enables and rewards sin under the guise of holy matrimony. If they wish to reward and empower those who desire to make a mockery of our faith, and misrepresent our religion, then we intend to remove ourselves altogether from this bureaucracy so that we may practice our faith in accordance to our beliefs.”", "title": "Married Christians Divorcing In Protest Of Gay Marriage", "url": "http://civictribune.com/married-christians-divorcing-protest-gay-marriage/", "main": "http://civictribune.com", "fact": ""}

The decision comes hot on the heels of the marijuana legalization measure which takes effect July 1st throughout Oregon.\n\nCarol Shapiro is the newly appointed coordinator for the Oregon Department of Marijuana Reparations, and he elaborated on how this system will work to get those effected by previous laws, back on their feet. “These were essentially incidents that should have never have been tried as crimes to begin with. Thousands of people have payed dearly over the years for laws which have criminalized a substance that is basically less dangerous than any over-the-counter painkiller.”\n\n“Individuals who was served prison time for drug offenses involving marijuana within the last 10 years will automatically be eligible for a refund of any fines and fees incurred as a result of those convictions, as well as compensation for pain and suffering endured from being incarcerated. These parties will also have their records automatically expunged. We are hoping that these actions will correct the injustices previously inflicted upon innocent citizens, and help them to go on with their lives.”\n\nThis news comes as a bittersweet relief to those who have faced serious consequences within the last 10 years for their involvement in marijuana growing operations.

It’s not like I am going to get those years of my life back or get the job back that I lost at the time. I don’t think the federal government is aware of the scope of what people have had to deal with when they went to jail for things as innocuous as marijuana. I didn’t see my kids for 2 years. I spent an additional 4 years on probation. It literally made my life hell and caused my family so much stress and anguish. I am glad they are trying to make up for it, but basically no amount of money is going to replenish what I lost when I got locked up for growing.

There has been several instances where adoptive parents do their best to raise a child in the correct manner, but the child’s genetic programming is too strong to ignore, regardless of efforts and investments of the adopter.

Activist groups lauded Jamie’s efforts at the time as both “courageous” and “inspirational”.\n\nOthers have been more cynical about Jamie’s intentions, because there’s just one problem: James Moorles has been on the Hanna, Wyoming sex offender registry since 2005. He has been arrested two times for lewd and lascivious acts with females under the age of 10, and spent a 2 year stint in a medium security prison.\n\nJamie Moorles dresses as a woman full time, and claims to have started hormone treatments within the last few months. During a recent interview with the local Hanna, Wyoming paper, Moorles told reporters that she has been cured of the affliction which caused her to commit her former crimes, and now as a trans woman is unable to pose a threat to children.\n\n“I just don’t have those kinds of filthy thoughts anymore” Jamie told reporters at the time “I’ve found out who I really am, and that’s a woman.

He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against women’s rights, gay rights and human rights in general; there’s absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place.

Reviews were mostly positive, aside from the usual bugs that you get from an open beta.\n\nLeague of Legends was Riot’s answer to DOTA (MOBA made by modding a Warcraft 3 map). To no one’s surprise, it got famous pretty quickly.\n\nOne of the most attractive and most important factors that propelled the game on almost every PC is that it is free to play.

Thus, they introduced a role-playing element to the match. Also, the player can use two spells that can help their hero in defeating their foe.\n\nLeague of Legends quickly became one of the most famous online games in the last decade and turned into e-sport material.\n\nWorld Championship 2017\n\nWorld Championship 2016 had a prize pool of 5.070.000 dollars, and the streams were seen by 43 million viewers worldwide.

Global attention has focused even more intensely on events in the United States, such as the 2016 presidential election, the Black Lives Matter movement and the push for marriage equality. Traditional concerns, such as political fundraising, remain important. However, those are also affected by new developments and innovations. While domestic and worldwide landscapes continue to change, higher education institutions keep pace so that their students are prepared for these new realities.\n\nPublic Administration Programs Include a Global Focus\n\nWhile public policy curricula at many colleges and universities are domestically focused, their faculty recognize the benefit of keeping an eye on trends in other nations. With the growing interconnectedness that’s characteristic of a changing international community, this is no surprise. For example, the Master of Public Administration program at the University of Southern California addresses the need for a global view, citing public service efforts in Canada, Columbia, Iceland and other nations.Click here to learn more about USC’s online MPA program. Although conditions in these countries differ from those in the United States, public administration experts here may be able to learn from these examples.\n\nFurthermore, some concerns have become universally important in nearly every part of the world. Although they may play out differently due to varying laws and customs, both governments and public policy officials understand the need for solutions. For instance, disabled people in Indonesia are dealing with issues similar to those in the United States. Global Public Policy Watch revealed this in a December 2016 article, highlighting problems such as reduced access to healthcare, employment, education and other critical needs.\n\nCampaign Fundraising in the 21st Century\n\nThe practice of fundraising for political campaigns has a long history in this country. We’re not in the days of President George Washington, but it’s interesting to note that his actions were likely the first impetus for campaign finance laws. A Ballotpedia article on the subject revealed that his act of buying booze for friends in an attempt to win a seat in the Virginia House of Burgesses prompted a ban on gifts in exchange for votes in 1757.\n\nIn this modern age, some truths remain constant. A recent article published by the George Washington University’s Master’s in Political Management site emphasized the need for effective fundraising to operate a candidate’s political campaign, offering some intelligent considerations when trying to get the support of donors.

Here is Kenya, a country full of resources for large and small business establishments. Local and foreign entrepreneurs are always welcomed here. According to Tuko News, the country has a growing potential and privileges in the field of entrepreneurship. If you still haven’t made your decision about business you want to run, here are some of the most popular and successful ideas for your consideration.\n\nSoap production\n\nThis is a solution for small enterprises. You won’t gain millions on it, but the income will be stable because soap is a constantly consuming product. You won’t need a lot of resources in the beginning. It means that with an appropriate business plan you can expect a fast return on investments. This decision is suitable for rich-boys-clubs. Soap production is a perfect opportunity for people who are looking for the next level of stability and enjoying life out of employment.\n\nBakery/restaurant/food business\n\nThis is another solution for long-term stability. Food production is always demanding and popular. Be it a bread bakery, pizza place, ice-cream truck, traditional food fancy restaurant for tourists, coffee shops with local coffee for tourists, fast food for locals; with a proper investment of efforts and money the venture will be successful. In contrast to soap production, this type of enterprise requires more human resources, like the right internal design, skilled cooks, pleasant sellers or waiters, and other. This venture cannot be run remotely.\n\nTea/coffee export\n\nTea and coffee export is a 20% part of the whole export of the country. It means, there are plenty of resources for interesting and money-making decisions in this brunch. This option is for big players. You can gain big payout depending on the scopes and the quality of the product. The risks of every business scheme is a close cooperation with government establishments and high taxes.\n\nCut flowers\n\nThis is another popular export product in Kenya, which remains in-demand in 2017. The model requires human resources skilled in flower arranging and planting, land resources, watering systems, active transport collaboration and other resources, which make the initial investment competitive. On the other hand, this is a relatively safe choice for those who want to play for the high stakes. Negative side includes high taxes.\n\nBusiness coaching\n\nThis is a fresh field for those who have already succeeded in establishing a few big or small enterprises. This is a good way not only to share the gained experience but also to earn more money. Business coaching is a relatively new branch. The positive aspects are an absence of initial investment, low level of business struggle and fast income. Negative sides and requirements include a presence of practical experience, full time and energy consuming job. It works perfectly for a self-realization of an experienced businessman.\n\nWedding/honeymoon planning\n\nThe number of couples who prefer a non-traditional way of a wedding ceremony is constantly growing as well as those who prefer exotic honeymoon trips. Organization of different types of services in Kenya can appear a pot of gold because most people cannot afford to do it themselves. You have to sell a social security. This idea requires little investments and establishment of regular international relations to find and attract foreign clients. With a fancy representation and high promotion, the idea might become a stable source of not only income but also positive emotions.\n\nSchool or college establishment\n\nThis is not only a business idea but also a way to change life in Kenya. The population of the country is now in need of additional education. This is not as hard as it seems. Building a school or college may not grant you with a great scope of money, but with a stable income, it will definitely allow you to change the world for the better.\n\nIn any case, starting your own business is always challenging and demanding. You may receive your first income in a few months or ten years. Patience must be your guide.

(AP) — For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.\n\n“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 38-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.”\n\nTrump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, but Horner disagrees.\n\n“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.”\n\n“I knew those weren’t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,” said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff.” Downey continued, “I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.”\n\nWhen asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.\n\n“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.\n\n“I’ll protest that guy for free,” Bradley said. “Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that.” Bradley continued, “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.”\n\nHorner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally.\n\n“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it.’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘F*ck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’.”\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”\n\nABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton’s campaign for comment but did not receive a response.

But that doesn’t mean that everyone receives a fair trial. In a perfect world, the judge and jury system would always be 100% balanced, but that simply isn’t the case. Many people who think that they don’t need an attorney actually do. If you are ever suspected of a crime, it is always best to have someone in your corner to defend you.\n\nA lawyer is trained in the legalities of auto negligence and whatever else you are charged with, be it negligence or a criminal act, and they know the best defensive moves. Finding the right professional is one of the most critical components for winning or losing your case.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone has enough disposable income to hire an attorney, nor do they have a choice in who defends them. Since you do have the right to a fair trial, which includes a court-appointed lawyer when necessary, is it prudent to use a court-appointed attorney to defend you in a DUI arrest?\n\nIf you cannot pay for a lawyer to protect you from a DUI conviction, the court has an obligation to supply you with a defense attorney. Included in your Miranda rights at arrest is the statement of your right to a fair trial and an attorney, should you not be able to afford one.\n\nHow to request a court-appointed attorney\n\nEven though every American citizen has the right to an attorney to defend them, a lawyer is not an inexpensive hire. Most criminal defense lawyers charge by the hour, which can sometimes be upwards of hundreds of dollars. If you can’t afford to hire someone for $300 or more an hour to defend you, the good news is that you don’t have to. A court-appointed lawyer is typically someone who is hired by the government to defend those who can’t afford to defend themselves.\n\nJust like any other lawyer, they have to take the standard care of practice in your defense. Practicing the same oath, they have an obligation to defend you to the best of their ability. If you can’t afford your own attorney, then you have to request a court-appointed representative. Once you do, you will have to provide documentation to prove that you can’t afford a lawyer on your own.\n\nYou can ask for a court-appointed lawyer the first time you appear before a judge at the arraignment. You can show up alone if you were able to make bail. If you weren’t able to pay the bail amount, the sheriff’s department will bring you in front of the judge to hear your case.\n\nWhen you are in front of the judge, you will be asked whether or not you have retained an attorney to defend you. If you do not have representation, they will also ask whether you are capable of hiring a lawyer or if you need one appointed for you. If there is an attorney available at the arraignment process they will stand in to represent you through the rest of the proceeding.\n\nThe lawyer at the arraignment process will typically not be the same as the one who will defend you throughout the case. If there is no attorney available for the arraignment, it may be postponed until an attorney can be present. The arraignment might also be delayed if your financials don’t provide enough evidence that you can afford an attorney on your own.\n\nAre court-appointed lawyers as good?\n\nThe best answer to the question whether a court-appointed attorney is just as good is that any criminal defense is better than none. Public defenders stand in front of the court on a daily basis and know the law better than many private attorneys. They have more experience and court time than most for-hire lawyers in the field.\n\nThe only drawback to having a court-appointed attorney is that they might not have as much disposable time to go over the incident with you, which means you might not get the same individual care that you would with a lawyer you hired. Being limited on time, they may have an overload of cases that would distract them from providing the best defense possible.\n\nIn the end, it is always better to have someone on your side. Don’t mistake a public defender as being someone who isn’t just as qualified and highly trained as a for-hire attorney. In fact, sometimes they know the law better and have more experience than even the best lawyers in the field.", "title": "Are Court-Appointed Defense Lawyers Sufficient For DUI Cases?", "url": "http://abcnews.com.co/court-appointed-defense-lawyers-sufficient-dui-cases/", "main": "http://abcnews.com.co", "fact": ""}

(AP) — Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values.”\n\n“The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is,” Obama said. “Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah’s Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this ‘one nation under God’, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying ‘liberty and justice for all’, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.”\n\nObama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of “under God” runs afoul of the First Amendment’s establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America’s values.\n\n“I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyone’s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.”\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledge’s language and suggested that the pledge’s mention of God sends the wrong message to America’s children.\n\n“I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.”\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the president’s order, referring to the president as an “illegitimate Muslim traitor.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban.\n\n“This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much .”\n\nLawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama’s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.\n\n“When our children are forced to chant, ‘One nation under God‘, whose God are they referring to exactly?” Ketchum said, “From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child’s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values.” Ketchum continued, “This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.”\n\nWhile Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.\n\n“Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a president’s executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.\n\n“It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money.

I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.” Mikkleson continues, “A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like ‘umimumimaginative’, ‘recycled’, ‘hoax’, saying that a story ‘illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations’, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, that’s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences.” Mikkelson further explains, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it.

The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in 1954 when the words “under God” were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place.”\n\nThe Obama Administration has set up a 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the new Executive Order.

(AP) — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.\n\n“People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,” Obama told reporters. “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.”\n\nUnder the President’s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.\n\nNot surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president’s decision.\n\n“Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn’t allow that to happen. President Obama doesn’t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.”\n\nThe president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.\n\n“We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.”\n\nPaul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.\n\n“Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states’ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.”\n\nPolitical Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President’s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.\n\n“[The electoral college] is a f—king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and that’s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It’s time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.”\n\nObama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.\n\n“We’re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,” Obama said. “Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn’t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?” Obama said. “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.”\n\nIf you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19th election, you can call the Obama administration’s special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.", "title": "Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation Into Election Results; Revote Planned For Dec. 19th", "url": "http://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-declaring-investigation-of-election-results/", "main": "http://abcnews.com.co", "fact": ""}

It is a four-letter word with more bite than the most vulgar words in the dictionary, but with the right approach it can be managed effectively and eventually controlled. Debt is unavoidable. It provides individuals, families, and corporations with the necessary funds for everyday purchases, and big-ticket items too. Many people have multiple lines of credit available to them, and managing that credit becomes an insurmountable challenge.\n\nVarious strategies have been proposed to assist individuals in lessening their overall debt burden, and moving towards financial independence. Debt can build up quickly, or the buildup can take place over several years. In any event, careful management is essential to ensure continued lines of credit, psychological well-being, and financial independence. The process of becoming debt-free requires a careful review of all finances. We all have a basic understanding of our income, debt and expenses.\n\nThe first step in the process of becoming debt-free requires an understanding of gross pay. Once all fixed expenses have been factored in, including retirement and savings, the discretionary income can be calculated. This is the money that is available for spending purposes. People tend to underestimate their financial obligations and debts, thereby overextending themselves when it comes to purchases. It’s important to document every single debt, the interest rate on that debt, and the minimum monthly payment due on a specific date. A debt elimination plan requires nothing less than brutal honesty.\n\nWork towards reducing monthly expenses\n\nIf personal disposable income typically remains in a tight range, it’s important to begin reducing variable expenses, or even eliminating them entirely. Many monthly expenses are not required such as unused gym memberships, video streaming memberships, massage or day spa memberships that lie dormant and the like. It may be necessary to simply eliminate certain expense items even if they are being used. Part of the problem with debt reduction is that many people refuse to budge on lifestyle standards. It may not be public knowledge, but hospitals, insurance companies, cell phone providers, and cable TV companies often have more affordable options for their clients. The next step in the process is prioritizing the most important debt. Naturally, home mortgages are priority #1. Car repayments are another priority, provided the vehicle being financed is not a luxury vehicle that is unaffordable. Funds should be directed away from unnecessary expenditures towards the priority items.\n\nThis is pretty much the same way the human body functions in times of a crisis. When a human being is stranded in a blizzard, the extremities are sacrificed to maintain the core organs such as the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, brain etc. All resources should be redirected to the most important items – this is a nonnegotiable point. When it comes down to making payments on debt, there are different thought processes to becoming debt free. Some credit management experts advise paying down the smallest items first. These incremental victories provide the necessary momentum to manage debt.\n\nContrarian Debt Repayment Plans\n\nOther experts advise paying down debt with the highest interest rate, and this certainly makes sense. Higher interest rates suck up more of your personal disposable income, rendering you poorer every month. Once the broad strategy has been mapped out, it’s important to schedule payments to creditors. Writing out checks every month is a timely and inefficient way of making payments. It is best to schedule payments prior to their due date, so that no late fees will be incurred if the payment doesn’t go through.\n\nExperts also advise avoiding making large payments all on the same date, especially when smaller payments can be made infrequently. Throughout it all, it’s important to avoid racking up more debt. Some folks believe that it is best to cancel credit cards that are not being used to avoid the enticement of using them. However, this may hurt your credit score by lowering the debt-to-credit ratio. Remember: It’s best to use cash available in your account over credit any day of the week.", "title": "Living Debt Free in an Era of Rising Costs", "url": "http://abcnews.com.co/living-debt-free-era-rising-costs/", "main": "http://abcnews.com.co", "fact": ""}

We want nothing to do with Mexico. If all the Mexican food is gone, Mexicans will start leaving as well”.\n\nAlthough many Trump supporters are most likely slowly becoming aware that their president is indeed suffering from some sort of yet to be diagnosed mental disorder, experts believe they will still continue to agree and follow with any of his actions. After recently failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, experts believe Trump felt he had to ban something to feel he was in control again, thus leading to the Taco Ban proposal.\n\nAccording to Trump, he will issue an executive order for the “Taco ban” in April, as he also did with the Muslim Ban. Stay tuned for updates on the “taco ban” and President Trump.\n\nHUZLERS.COM", "title": "President Trump Pushing For The Ban Of Mexican Food In The U.S.", "url": "https://www.huzlers.com/taco-ban-president-trump-pushing-for-the-ban-of-mexican-food-in-the-u-s/", "main": "https://www.huzlers.com", "fact": ""}

Headlines using the words oust and ouster can be found on Politico, Forward, and even Guns. One site called The Daily Banter says that Roger Stone accused Jared Kushner of ousting Bannon.\n\nI guess I don’t see what the big deal is. This was clearly part of the plan. No one who is reasonable ever expected Steve Bannon to stay on the Council.\n\nSteve Bannon is an operational guru. Look at what he has done with Breitbart. I am not talking about the Conservative nature of Breitbart, I am talking about logistics, organization, structure, process and OPERATION of Breitbart!\n\nSteve Bannon in many ways is responsible for the rise of Breitbart. Without his Operational oversite, Breitbart would still be a no-name blog that writes about Conservative Politics… Kind of like mine. 😉 Clearly, Steve Bannon has a track record of fixing operational issues.\n\nSimmer Down!\n\nMy friends on the right need to relax, it was all part of the plan. My friends on the left need to go ahead and open the Champaign anyway. Like it or not, Steve Bannon just saved the Left from the same fate we suffered under Susan Rice.\n\nNow that his job is done, the Left doesn’t need to worry about the Whitehouse wire tapping the supporters of their political opponents.\n\nHave a look at what Fox News says about his removal…\n\nPresident Trump said he was going to Drain the Swamp. Part of Draining the Swamp means changing how certain groups operate. It looks like President Trump is well on his way to Draining the Swamp!\n\nLet’s share the good news about President Trump’s progress!\n\nGod Bless!
